In an interview with People she said, "My daughters were like, 'Wait what?' My youngest daughter, she reminded me, she was like, 'Wait a minute mom, are you the same mom that was like girl, I'm strictly d***ly?' And I was like, 'Wah, wah. Like yeah, but no.'"</p><p>So who is her partner, <a href=#>Jessica Betts</a>? Here's what we know about the woman Niecy calls her "hersband," including her net worth, career, and more.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What is Jessica Betts' net worth?</h2><p>It's been reported that Jessica's net worth is around $500,000. She's a singer/songwriter originally from Chicago, Ill. who made the move from the Windy City to the Big Apple. She has a few TV credits to her name, like playing a ticket agent in the TV movie CODE 11-14, along with Rebellious Soul: The Musical. Her most recent role was as Nadege in a 2018 episode of Claws, but she and Niecy met some three years before that.</p><p>In fact, Niecy and Jessica met around the time Jessica won the reality TV series The Road to Stardom with Missy Elliott. A few years prior to that, in 2011, she was also featured on BET as a Music Matters artist (the same year her #LLCoolJess EP was released). In 2000, Jessica was credited as a writer for the song "Get Up" in the fat-suit comedy Big Momma's House.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Most recently, Jessica Betts has been featured in a number of talk shows, like 'Red Table Talk.'</h2><p>Jada Pinkett Smith's Facebook Watch series Red Table Talk had its Season 4 premiere, and the show's guests were none other than Niecy and Jessica.</p><p>In the episode, Niecy joked that she didn't receive "a welcome packet" from the LGBTQ+ community following her marriage to Jessica, whom she calls "the most beautiful soul [she's] ever met."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Niecy Nash (@niecynash1)</a></p></figure><p>In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Niecy called Jessica her "hersband" and doesn't think that her decision to get married to another woman is her necessarily "coming out."</p><p>"A lot of people say that, like, 'Oh, you came out!' and I say, 'Well, from out of where?' You know what I mean? I wasn't anywhere to come out of. I wasn't living a sexually repressed life when I was married to men, I just loved them when I loved them.

I love who I love. At one point in my life, I married twice and I love those people. And today I love this person. I've done everything I wanted to do on my own terms and my own way. So my choice now in a partner has nothing to do with who I've always been. It's a matter of who I am in this moment."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Niecy Nash (@niecynash1)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Where can I watch Niecy Nash and Jessica Betts' 'Red Table Talk' episode?</h2><p>The episode will premiere on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Table Talk's Facebook page</a>.
