In fact, it's basically the most unhinged social media platform out there. And if it deems a particular action dangerous, then it must actually be dangerous.</p><p>But of course, some creators have been disregarding TikTok's warnings and immersing themselves in death diving, which has been trending on the platform. Below, we discuss what death diving is and why it's exclusive to trained <a href=#>athletes</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is death diving?</h2><p>To explain death diving, think of diving, but instead of jumping into the water off a diving board, death diving involves jumping from great heights (10 meters and up) and plunging into the water.</p><p>While many TikTok users are learning of death diving for the first time, it's actually been around for over 50 years.</p><p>Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Norwegian American</a>, death diving originated in Norway in the late 1960s under the name “dødsing.” It started as a way for men to show off their bravery but later evolved into an extreme sport that is still watched today.</p><p>TikToker Asbjørg Nesje (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@asbjorg_n</a>) is one of the creators who has popularized death diving on TikTok.<strong> </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But unlike some of the folks who have been trying the trend</a>, she is a trained athlete who is equipped to jump from such tall heights.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@asbjorg_n href=#>@asbjorg_n</a><p>This one deserves it’s own video. <a title=døds href=#>#døds</a> <a title=deathdiving href=#>#deathdiving</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Asbjørg Nesje" href=#>♬ original sound - Asbjørg Nesje</a></figure><p>In her clip above, which garnered over 43 million views, she plunges off a wooden platform that is 81 feet in the air before making a splash in the water.
