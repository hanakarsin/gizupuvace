Almost every Grey's Anatomy fan has strong opinions about Jackson Avery and his ex-wife, April Kepner. Well, tonight people are expecting some kind of Japril reunion, and they're about to get a major treat. While we assumed that April was happily re-married to Matthew, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore, as of tonight's episode, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Well, tonight people are expecting some kind of Japril reunion, and they're about to get a major treat. While we assumed that April was happily re-married to Matthew, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore, as of tonight's episode, "Look Up Child."</p><p>“She’s still been living in Seattle with [her husband] Matthew and co-parenting Harriet. Everything that you’ve all assumed of where she’s been, that’s where she’s been,” actress Sarah Drew <a href=# rel=nofollow>told Entertainment Tonight</a>. The episode was likely poised to be more about Jackson than it is Jackson and April, as an episode synopsis reads, "Jackson pays a visit to his father that helps set him on the right path on a new episode of Grey’s Anatomy." But...that changed.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do April and Jackson end up together?</h2><p>April and Jackson probably might just end up together on Grey's Anatomy. We just learned that April and Matthew are splitting up, and that Jackson is moving to Boston to pursue a career in equitable healthcare (it's been confirmed that Jesse Williams is leaving the show) — something he's always dreamed of. And April and Harriet are following him! While this doesn't mean that they're 100 percent endgame, it's still good news for #Japril fans.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>“He’s going through something big and she’s the one that is there to listen," Sarah confirmed, in regard to #Japril. And while Jackson is currently in a steamy friends-with-benefits situation with Jo Wilson...it may go south. And Jesse has hinted about this recently.</p><p>"I think it’s great. I think it’s fun. Camilla’s a lot of fun to work with. There is a lightness, a comedic kind of tightrope that they’re walking because we’re keeping it light, but I feel like this could go badly at any moment," Jesse Williams <a href=# rel=nofollow>shares with ET</a>.</p><p>He also thinks that Jo is what Jackson needs (and vice versa), saying,&nbsp;</p>"They are giving each other confidence. Like, 'Look, I like this about you. I am really into this about you and that’s enough,'&nbsp;which is really all a lot of us are asking sometimes... [for someone to say,] 'I like you exactly the way you are and that’s good enough for me. Sometimes that doesn’t necessarily have to be revolutionary in our life, but it just gives us something solid that we can touch and feel and we know it’s there and we can go on about our day."<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>However, Jesse really loved the chemistry between his character and April as well. "They are incredible together. I am a fan [of Drew's] and she is absolutely one of the most special people I’ve worked with. We developed those storylines together with our incredible writers, so it’ll always hold a very real place in my heart and memories. We stay in contact. She is the sweetest," Jesse said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by jesse Williams (@ijessewilliams)</a></p></figure><p>He added that he would "love any opportunity for [Jackson and April] to continue that story" because the ex couple "have an ability to communicate and be vulnerable with each other and push each other." Even though logistics were hard (Sarah had left the show in 2018 after nine whole seasons), it looks like they're going to make it work somehow.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who does Jackson Avery end up with?</h2><p>At this point, we don't know if Jackson will certainly end up with April or not, but that seems to be what Grey's Anatomy is leaning toward. With Jesse Williams leaving the show, we're going to find out one way or another.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Grey's does have a tendency to keep surprising us after all these years.
