Here’s what we know about a <a href=#>new romance that bloomed on Vanderpump Rules</a>. And, we'll reveal who Tom is said to be linked to following his on-screen kiss.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom Schwartz was rumored to be dating another ‘Vanderpump Rules’ co-star after his divorce.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Although Tom and Katie both previously said that their 2022 divorce was amicable, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Katie's opinion of her ex went south when Tom was seen making out with <a href=#>Raquel Leviss</a>.</p><p>First, as a quick refresher on the love story of Katie and Tom, the couple actually got together pre-Vanderpump Rules (was there such a time?). It was 2017 when the lovebirds said “I do,” per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly.</a> In 2019, they were seemingly so into one another that they had a second wedding! But by 2022, the marriage was over, with Tom insinuating on Instagram that the decision to end things was Katie’s.</p><p>Even so, don’t think that Katie was thrilled to see her former spouse locking lips with Raquel at <a href=#>Scheana Shay’s wedding to Brock Davies</a>. Ahead of the Season 10 premiere, rumors were already circulating that the co-stars had become more than friends.</p><p>However, it seems pretty clear at this point that scandalously, Raquel has been <a href=#>secretly dating Tom Sandoval</a>, who was in a long-term relationship with Ariana Madix. <a href=#>Tom and Ariana</a> are no more, and Raquel is definitely enduring a <a href=#>PR nightmare</a> that has nothing to do with Tom Schwartz. Instead, he has moved on to someone new.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom Schwartz is reportedly dating someone who is linked to the cast, but is not a Bravolebrity.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tom Schwartz (@twschwa)</a></p></figure><p>In addition to the ongoing bromance between Tom Schwartz and Tom Sandoval, the former is reportedly coupled up with someone outside of the incestuous circle of castmates on Vanderpump Rules.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Tom is seeing hairstylist Jo Wenberg, with the two spending time together in Los Angeles. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom previously claimed</a> that he and Jo are just friends, and that she was actually his roommate, the outlet speculates they have moved on to romantic status.</p><p>Tom has called Jo "a beautiful soul," and "a really cool human being," so the fact that he reportedly fell for her shouldn't shock many fans. Still, it's important to note that at time of writing, Tom had not confirmed that he is officially dating Jo, and instead, recently declared he is not ready for another relationship after his 12-year romance with Katie ended.</p><p>"I'm kind of falling in love with myself all over again," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom said</a>, while denying that he was more than friends — and at least one-time roommates — with Jo, who is a close friend of <a href=#>Kristen Doute</a>, another Vanderpump Rules star.</p><p>Guess we'll have to wait and see if Tom and Jo are indeed friends or more than that as Season 10 of the addictive Bravo show continues to play out for fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyuedKcn7CZoqnHbrDAraCnnw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
