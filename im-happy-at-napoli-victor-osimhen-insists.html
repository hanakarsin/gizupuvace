The club reportedly issued a private apology to the player after the striker’s agent threatened to sue the team over the incident.</p><p>On the other hand, Napoli’s president had made hints that Osimhen would be sold in 2024 if he did not agree to a new deal. It was reported that this had put Chelsea and Liverpool, who are reportedly in the lead to sign Osimhen, on red alert.</p><p>However, Victor Osimhen insisted in a recent Twitch interview with Mario Balotelli and Emiliano Viviano that he is “happy at Napoli”.</p><p>He added: “People don’t know how difficult it is to play in Serie A.
