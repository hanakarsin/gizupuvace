Source: MTVPeople tune into the Jersey Shore series to catch all the drama that follows the castmates around. Sometimes it seems fabricated to make for better TV, but other times the happenings seem so far out there it's painfully obvious it's real. One of those moments was the wedding episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One of those moments was the wedding episode of <a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a>. As a result, people want to know: <a href=#>Does Angelina still talk to the Jersey Shore cast</a>?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened on the wedding episode of 'Jersey Shore'?</h2><p>Jersey Shore is known for drama, but this whole season has been leading up to the long-awaited wedding of&nbsp;Angelina Pivarnick, which was kind of a mess. More of a mess than viewers could have imagined. We got to see the aftermath of the bridesmaid speech that set Angelina off and had the guests booing at fellow Jersey Shore cast members, Jenni “JWoww” Farley, Deena Cortese, and Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Happy 6 months babe the time flies when you’re having fun ❤️. #6months #unbreakable #bestfriends #livingourbestlife #memoriesforlife #photooftheday #smiling</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Angelina Lashelina</a> (@angelinamtv) on May 20, 2020 at 5:11pm PDT</p></figure><p>In their speech, Jenni, Nicole, and Deena turned a moment that's typically used to share their love and congrats to the new couple into a roast.

Don’t let it ruin your night.” However, Angelina couldn't let it go.</p><p>“I think we should go outside and flip out,” she says. “I’m not happy. I was laughing at first, but then I looked at you and I’m like…it just kept going on and on and on. We should go outside and flip out.”&nbsp;</p><p>She said she was trying to laugh it off, but she was hurt. “It’s the wrong f***ing place. It’s the wrong time. You don’t do this at somebody’s wedding. I f***ing lose it," Angelina said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Angelina still talk to the other 'Jersey Shore' cast members?</h2><p>People on social media could see why Angelina was so hurt.
