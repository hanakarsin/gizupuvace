Source: NBCThe 2020 Tokyo Olympics were officially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and even though most of the world is slowly ditching the &#34;new normal&#34; in favor of the &#34;old normal,&#34; there are many who are still concerned about contracting the coronavirus. Vaccinations are being rolled out more and more frequently, but there's still a chance that athletes, who are traveling from all over the world to participate in the Olympic games will be at risk of contracting COVID-19."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Olympic committee understands that there's still a threat of athletes and attendees catching COVID, so they've published <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Playbook</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>The Playbook is a guide that touches on all operational protocols for the 2020 (2021) Olympic Games in Tokyo, and it includes how to handle potential COVID-19 cases.</p><p>It's important to note that event organizers aren't stipulating that participants must be vaccinated, but competitors must take two separate COVID-19 tests 96 hours before departing to Japan.</p><p>Their tests must come back negative before they can even check in at the airport. Once they arrive in Japan, they must take another COVID-19 test upon entering the country, which must also come back negative. After gaining entry into the country, they are then required to quarantine for no less than three days.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A second COVID-19 case linked to the Ugandan Olympic team has been detected after a coach tested positive on arrival in Japan, an Izumisano city official has said.<a href=#>https://t.co/g2sUSMI5IK</a> | <a href=#>#VisionSports</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OPkEIiDCX4</a></p>â€” The New Vision (@newvisionwire) <a href=#>June 23, 2021</a></figure><p>Athletes aren't off the hook for testing after that, however. They will then receive rapid saliva Antigen tests daily.</p><p>Athletes are also asked to wear face masks when they aren't eating, sleeping, training, or competing, and they are also told to avoid gratuitous physical contact, like hugging and kissing, which may prove problematic given some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">salacious stories that come out of the Olympic Village</a>.</p><p>The Playbook also insists that athletes only use Olympics-approved transportation vehicles and avoid other commuting means during their time in Tokyo, and there will be temperature checks every time an athlete enters a venue.</p><p>If, with all of these guidelines and precautions in place, an athlete still contracts COVID, they are immediately expected to quarantine and will not be allowed to compete.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My piece in <a href=#>@theipaper</a> a month before the Tokyo <a href=#>#Olympics</a>.<br>What will the legacy of these Games be?

If you're trying to travel to Tokyo during the Olympics to cheer on your country's athletes, you can't. You'll have to tune in from the comfort of your own home. Japanese fans will get to watch the games in person, however. The venue's only allowed to be at 50 percent capacity, meaning a maximum of 10,000 people will be present at all times.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Meanwhile, massive increase in Delta in Cornwall as a result of G7 super spreader event.
