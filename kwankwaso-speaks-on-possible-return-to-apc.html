We don’t want any permanent enemy. What we want are permanent friends. It is very important. We work for friendship.</p><p>“It will amaze you that some of my friends who we started working with 30 years ago, many of them are still alive and we are together. Even those who died from 30 years ago to date are in our record and every year, we do one thing or the other for their families. So, in 2023, I believe many things are likely to happen.</p><p>So, anything can happen in 2023. This is what happened to the PDP, the other is the APC. The APC is still doing all sorts of manoeuvres. They are playing the game the way they understand it and they can make mistakes. And once they make mistakes, the result may even be worse than what happened to the PDP. And that is another factor. For us, we are very flexible. We are looking at the situation as it is and we are looking at history and projecting into the future and ensure that this country gets the best leadership.”</p><p>This follows the report that Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje <strong><a href=#>had said he was open to settling differences</a></strong> with Kwankwaso, Ibrahim Shekarau and other political actors in the state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49rZqSvkaO4uK3SqGSsqJWWuLR5zqdkqaejqLajuMRmqZ6spae7bsDOZpipm18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
