Because social distancing is still very much necessary, people have come up with creative solutions to keep people safe while still allowing them to enjoy different activities."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The hope is that each party will pick a circle and stay in it (and away from other parties) for the duration of their park visit. As someone who used to be a softball pitcher, I'm very used to staying in my circle, so this sounds pretty good to me.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This restaurant in Maryland intends to use bumper tables to keep customers six feet apart once it begins to take seated diners. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ReCLbzcowF</a></p>— CBS News (@CBSNews) <a href=#>May 18, 2020</a></figure><p>These bumper tables are a little bit silly, sure, but they also look kind of fun.

Wow. I would like to dine next to a stuffed capybara (or better yet, a real one!) every day of my life. This Twitter user explains that this zoo chose capybaras because they are credited with being the first to introduce the animals to hot baths, which has since become "a thing." Also, they're really adorable.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My grocery store has replaced the salad in the salad bar with.... liquor. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eGemUkvbj8</a></p>— Emily A.

But it wasn't exactly "back to normal." They stayed six feet apart and got temperature checks before entering the building.
