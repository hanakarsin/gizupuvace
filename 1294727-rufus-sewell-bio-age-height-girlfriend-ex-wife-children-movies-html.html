His father was an Australian animator who had worked on The Beatles Yellow Submarine cartoon, while his mother was an artist.</p><p class=align-left>When he was five years old, his parents separated. After the break-up, they fell on hard times. His mother worked in a pub and sold vegetables from the back of her car to support their family. When Rufus was ten, tragedy struck the family as his father passed away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9afeb30bd7809772.jpg><p class=align-left>In his teens, Rufus Sewell was quite stubborn. He would smoke both cigarettes and MJ and would drink alcohol. During this challenging time, a teacher suggested that Sewell should join a drama class, and this changed his life. He realized that he had a passion for acting, and this helped him set the course of his life. He enrolled at The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London in 1986, where he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graduated three years later</a> in 1989.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0b612630ca3e2611.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>John Cusimano's bio: what is known about Rachael Ray's husband?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While studying at the drama school, he met the famous Dame Judi Dench, who took a liking to him.

He is currently 52-years-old and will be turning 53 later this year.</p><h3>Rufus Sewell brother</h3><p class=align-left>Rufus and his older brother Caspar are just three years apart. Due to their closeness in age, they had a very contentious relationship when they were younger as they were always in each other's way. Caspar even once nicknamed him 'the fat white duke' after Rufus dyed his hair blond.</p><p class=align-left>Despite the friction in their childhood, today, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two are very close</a>. The actor describes his older brother as a sincere person. Caspar Sewell works as a landscape gardener.
