She debuted as an actress when she took part in small off-broad-way plays such as “Small Town Gals with Big Problems”, “The Killer Inside Me”, and “Urban Planning”. Her first TV appearance was on a number of TV shows such as; Due South (1994), The Commish (1991), Misery Loves Company (1995), and Nowhere Man (1995). Her big breakthrough in TV happened when she got cast as part of the Mr. & Mrs. Smith show. She was the Mrs. Smith of the TV series.</p><p class=align-left>It is unfortunate that only after 8 weeks of existence, the show was cancelled.

This show aired on NBC from September 19, 1994, to April 2, 2009. It mainly revolved around the happenings and life of staff and workers in the emergency room (ER) of a fictional County General Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. A number of critical things happened to the physicians as well as the staff that used the room. Maria became a guest-star in the show where she acted as Dr. Anna Del Amico.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6bea3641a8554573.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Delta Burke: Gerald McRaney relationship, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/36fd28c9d82887dc.jpg><p class=align-left>Being a major success in the show, and because of Maria's impressive work, she was able to draw a lot of attention leading to the debut of Bello's movie in 1998 known as ‘Permanent Midnight’.

It seemed when I was physically attracted to someone, I would put them in the box of being my 'soul mate' and then be crushed when things didn't turn out as I had hoped. As I continued to look through photos, I came across a black-and-white one of my best friend and me taken on New Year's Eve. We looked so happy, I couldn't help but smile, it didn't occur to me, until that soul-searching moment in my garden, that we could perhaps choose to love each other romantically.'</i>'<p class=align-left>This confirmed that the Maria Bello girlfriend story was indeed true and not a rumour.</p><p class=align-left>It is these strong opinions and personal interests that give her an enticing personality.
