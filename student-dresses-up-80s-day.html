The combatants, after asking Calypso to grant them their wishes with the esoteric powers he possessed, usually found out the hard way that they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">needed to be very specific in the way they phrased their wishes</a>.</p><p>But <a href=#>taking advantage of vague phrasing</a> doesn't always have to have such macabre implications. Sometimes, getting to say the phrase "But you didn't say..." can have some downright adorable and hilarious consequences ‚Äî something this mom's kid demonstrated when they went to school on '80s Day fully decked out in their period-appropriate costume.</p><p>Here's the thing, though: the kid's school never specific which century of the '80s that they meant, and X user Dr. Frizzle's (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@swilua</a>) kid took advantage of the lack of this distinction. Which the mom showed off in a throwback picture she posted to the social media platform, where it promptly went viral.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Throwback to when it was ‚Äú80‚Äôs day‚Äù at my child‚Äôs school and my very contrarian child noticed they never specified which century <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Eeo6JYtYBe</a></p>‚Äî üåàDr. Frizzle (@Swilua) <a href=#>June 11, 2024</a></figure><p>Her post contained two photos of her daughter decked out in an outfit that looked like it'd be more at home in Downtown Abbey than Miami Vice (and we're talking about the original TV show and not the weird Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx re-release).</p><p>She went all out: we're talking a bunch of lace, including frilly gloves, a parasol, floral patterns, layers ‚Äî she was certainly Jane Austen-ing it up.</p><p>In a follow-up post, the mother stated that while other kids in the school didn't really seem to appreciate her daughter's sense of humor, or style, faculty members thought it was fantastic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We had "Country Day" at the school where I teach.

Like this person who wrote: "We had 'Country Day' at the school where I teach. Most kids wore cowboy boots and baseball caps. One kid was France."</p><p>Another kid decided to abide by the color requirements for another day of festivities by technically abiding by it, while still getting to dress up as a superhero: "For the queen's last jubilee, the kids at my daughter's school were meant to come dressed in red, white, and blue. One kid wore a Spider-man costume."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love this so much! I did this on ‚Äúdecades‚Äù day in high school. Wore my trek garb (in PA, maybe it would have been more normal in UT?) and all the normal kids were very confused by my attire. Are the 1840s not a decade?</p>‚Äî Molly (@mogro719) <a href=#>June 11, 2024</a></figure><p>And as it turns out, there were other people who had the same idea as Dr. Frizzle's kid, like this user who simply wrote "same" and included a photo of two high school students who were repping outfits from the 1980s and then an entirely different century.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=es dir=ltr>Same<br>circa 2014 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XXOLkwRXmr</a></p>‚Äî julia (@julesdmuells) <a href=#>June 11, 2024</a></figure><p>And there was another person who said that due to all of the different types of outfits folks were rocking in the 1980s, the student more than likely would have fit right in during that decade: "The 1980s were such a wildly non-homogenous decade fashion-wise, I'm sure there were people dressing like that anyway.
