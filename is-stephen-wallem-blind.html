Although The Resident has been in limbo, it appears that the staff at Chastain Memorial Hospital isn’t done saving lives just yet. Despite fears that the series might be canceled, ahead of the Season 5 finale, Fox revealed that the series had been renewed alongside fellow Fox dramas 9-1-1 and 9-1-1 Lone Star."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In November, the actor made his debut on the series as Winston.</p><p>According to the character’s description, Winston is visually impaired. But is Stephen really blind? Here’s what we know about the actor.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stephen Wallem</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is ‘The Resident’s Stephen Wallem really blind?</h2><p>In Season 5 of The Resident, Winston was rushed to the hospital after a severe car accident. Viewers later learned that he’s legally blind and uses his cane to navigate. Later, things went left when Winston wandered out of his comfort zone.</p><p>Winston’s struggle is one that Stephen can relate to because, much like his character on The Resident, Stephen is visually impaired in real life. Years ago, Stephen was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and lost sight in one of his eyes as a result. And according to the actor, his appearance on the show is a testament to why representation is necessary both in the workplace and on television.</p><p>Following the episode’s premiere, Twitter sang his praises. In response, Stephen took to social media to reiterate others' comments about what it's been like working on the set of The Resident: "What I so deeply appreciate is that there has been no pointing out of Winston’s blindness as far as it hindering his work in any capacity. It’s just one aspect of who he is, and his co-workers treat him as an equal."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And what I so deeply appreciate is that there has been no pointing out of Winston’s blindness as far as it hindering his work in any capacity.

But this isn’t the first time he’s portrayed a character with a disability. It appears that Stephen isn’t new to advocacy, he’s true to it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Before 'The Resident,' Stephen Williams starred in 'Nurse Jackie.'</h2><p>In the past, Stephen has been candid about his health struggles both on-and-off screen. In Nurse Jackie, Stephen stars as Thor Lundgren, who also has diabetes. He spoke about the experience in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diabetes Health</a>.</p><p>“It certainly helps that they wrote in diabetes as part of my character, and that has forced me to be more honest with people I work with,” he said of his role in the Showtime series.</p><p>"I used to be very embarrassed about telling people that I had this condition," he continued. "I didn’t want to stick out, and I didn’t want to feel strange. But since the day I made the decision to be flat-out honest with people and not try to hide my medical bracelet, people for the most part have been completely supportive."</p><p>Catch more of Stephen Wallem when The Resident returns for Season 6 in the fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuv9Oep6GdnmLEorjLnqRmmpyeu6U%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
