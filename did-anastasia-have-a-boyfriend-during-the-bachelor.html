She got called out during the Women Tell All.</h2><p>Anastasia took a lot of heat this season, and it isn't over yet. During the preview for Season 27’s Women Tell All, the 30-year-old content marketing manager was accused of having a boyfriend during her time on the show.</p><p>When met with the allegation, Anastasia countered, “I did not have a boyfriend,” and Victoria J. replied, “OK, boyfriend, you were f--king, I don’t know!” And the drama doesn’t stop there.</p><p>According to Reality Steve, Anastasia going on The Bachelor for the “wrong reasons” will be a hot topic during the special — as will her co-star Christina Mandrell.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>“I know that Christina is going to be a big topic, and I also know that Anastasia is going to be a big topic because of the social media stuff and something that I had heard all season long that somebody called her out for,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the spoiler reporter revealed on his podcast</a>. “Anastasia and Christina take a lot of heat at the Women Tell All.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So, is there any evidence to back Victoria J.’s claim that Anastasia had a boyfriend during the filming of The Bachelor?

There’s no way to truly prove if they were [boyfriend and girlfriend], but clearly she was very close to another guy pre-filming and post-filming, and any statement by her to the contrary is a flat out lie.”</p><p>However, given Anastasia’s early elimination and the vague nature of relationship labels, Reality Steve didn’t find the information necessarily pressing to share. He pointed out that Anastasia wasn’t the first contestant to pull something like this — and won’t be the last.</p><p>The Bachelor Season 27’s Women Tell All airs on ABC Tuesday, Mar. 14 at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecCnmKyskai2onnHmq2eZZFir7DFxaugnqaUYrG2vsinnmasmJp6o63CoZylp6I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
