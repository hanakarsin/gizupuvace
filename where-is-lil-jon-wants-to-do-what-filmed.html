According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheCinemaholic</a>, Lil Jon Wants to Do What? was filmed in the state of Georgia, primarily in Atlanta. Aside from Lil Jon’s connection to the area, Georgia has served as a popular filming location for many notable projects including Flight, Superfly, <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</a>, and plenty more. After all, since the city calls the Tyler Perry Studios home and is known to have various Marvel movies filmed in the city, it makes perfect sense for production to head to Atlanta.</p><p>Anitra also hails from the Peach State. The production team reportedly filmed all around notable neighborhoods and residential properties throughout the city.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lil Jon first met Anitra in 2017 after she helped him fix up his Atlanta home.</h2><p>While some HGTV hosts are paired together with other home experts and real estate specialists, Lil Jon and Anitra are the exceptions.

So I had to find someone to figure out how to make the walls look like concrete that’s crumbling a little bit like it’s super old. And through working with Anitra, we just figured out that we work really well together.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Lil Jon went on to share that Anitra’s husband, Adam, pointed out that the pair works well together. So, the idea of creating a show in the home improvement space was a natural next step.</p><p>"'Y’all should really do this together for real because y’all work so well together, and y’all both have really good ideas,'" Lil Jon recalls Adam saying. "And so we ended up shooting a pilot, and a couple years later, HGTV picked it up."</p><p>Lil Jon Wants to Do What? airs Mondays at 10 p.m. on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlnJ65brbOp2SwmZ6pwG7AzmabqGWnna61ecWio6adlA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
