Walking away from abuse should not take away your fundamental human rights and dignity as a woman.</p><p>“What just happened with the assistant Commissioner of police at the AIG’S office (Zone 17) in Akure is a pointer to the fact that the system has failed womanhood again. Does it mean that walking away from a relationship mean you should commit suicide? More updates coming.”</p><p>Reacting in the comment section of her post, the Queen’s younger sister, Simi stated that no woman deserves what the queen went through, adding that it was time to speak out.</p><p>She wrote: “No woman deserves 1% of what you went through, still going through, you have really tried and enough is enough!!! It’s about time the sleeping dog wakes.”</p><p>Replying Simi’s comment, the mother of one revealed that she would rather die when she is pushed to a limit. She wrote, “It will be a rude awakening. You know when I’m pushed I will rather die….thank you all for standing by me through this difficult period. They don’t know what’s going on but God will be faithful.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls that the estranged queen announced her separation from the Ooni of Ife on December 23, 2021.
