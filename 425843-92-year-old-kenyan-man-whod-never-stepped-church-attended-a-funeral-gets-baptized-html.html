There was a lot of food, money and women,” he noted.<p class=align-left>He remembered the days gone by when he turned down all attempts by <a href=#>family</a> and friends to convince him to get saved.</p><p class=align-left>Nyapoya disclosed that he has never visited a hospital and didn't attend formal school because his father did not attach value to <a href=#>education</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9953d0c8683938f5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Surprised as Stranger Knocks on His Door, Pays KSh 131,000 House Rent</span></p></a>“We were herding our father’s animals and when I became an adult, I ventured into fishing because that was the only economic activity that majority were doing other than farming,” he said.<p class=align-left>The baptism opens a new journey for Nyapoya, one that will hopefully take away the hate and evil that he says had filled his heart.</p><h3>Baptised as Paul</h3><p class=align-left>Like in the Bible, Father Stephen Ouma baptised Nyapoya as Paul, opening a new chapter in his Christian life.</p><p class=align-left>The man of God noted that he gave the new convert a new name as it symbolizes Biblical change.</p>“Paul was up and down but finally saw the light and changed. This old man gave consent and I had no option but to prepare him to the kingdom of God,” Father Ouma said.<p class=align-left>Now that he has a baptismal medal hanging from his neck, Nyapoya looks at the future with pride as he takes the road into the Christian faith.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c26d0d153aaeea3a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Angry Husband Shares Pictures of Wife Kissing His Long-Time Friend, Says He'll Take Legal Action</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Father Ouma explained that it was inspiring for the new convert to seek salvation especially at such an advanced age of his life.</p><p class=align-left>He also added that old men like Nyapoya do not necessarily need to attend catechism classes before being baptised.</p><h3>Seth Mahiga resigns from Atheism</h3><p class=align-left>Nyapoya's case is reminiscent of Seth Mahiga's, the one-time chairperson of the Atheists in Kenya Society (AIK) who resigned from the position.</p><p class=align-left>He noted that he had found Jesus Christ and was, therefore, <a href=#>no longer interested in promoting atheism</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Mahiga's resignation elicited mixed reactions on social media with many congratulating him for the bold decision.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
