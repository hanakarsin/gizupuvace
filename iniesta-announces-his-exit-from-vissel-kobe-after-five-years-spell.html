The 39-year-old former Spain international who is one of the highest-paid athletes in the world has played only three times this season all from the bench.</p><p>Even though he has decided to leave the Japanese club due to a lack of regular playing time, the four times UEFA Champions League winner is not thinking of retiring yet.</p><p>With 133 games since joining Vissel in 2018, Iniesta has contributed to the team’s victory in the regional Emperor’s Cup and the Japanese Super Cup.</p><p>“I want to finish my time here properly and then see what options are available to me,” he said.</p><p>“I want to keep playing and then retire while I’m still active. That’s difficult for me to do here, so I want to find a place where I can eventually retire.”</p><p>The Spanish legend noted that choosing to leave Vissel was “one of the hardest decisions of my career”.</p><p>He added, “I always thought I would retire here, but things haven’t gone as I wanted them to.</p><p>“For the past few months I’ve trained hard to contribute to the team, but I started to feel that the coach had different priorities.”</p><p>Throughout his 22-year career at Barcelona, Iniesta played in 674 senior matches and won 32 titles for the Spanish giants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5FuZqKmmZrAta2MmqWnp6WjsKa%2FjKGgrGWVrba1ecWrpqZlpp7AtLHLZqKompVirqfAxKtkn6Gmmnq6scCrqmaroJq5rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
