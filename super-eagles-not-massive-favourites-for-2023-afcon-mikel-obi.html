They will play the hosts, Ivory Coast, on January 18, and end the group stage with a game against Guinea Bissau on January 22.</p><p>The Eagles are aiming to win the tournament for the 4th time in their history after winning it in 1980, 1994, and 2013. They finished second in 1984, 1990, 2000, and 1988.</p><p>In an interview with CAFonline ahead of the tournament which will kick off on January 13, Mikel Obi said: “We are always favourites, this is every time we go into the tournament and it’s no different this time.</p><p>“Everyone knows that we are one of the favourites – not the massive favourite but definitely one of the favourites.”</p><p>On the possibility of the Super Eagles winning after 10 years of waiting, Mikel Obi added: “To be able to do it again will be a massive achievement for us which I think the country needs right now as well. We need to get our football back where it should be and by winning this tournament, it will take it back to where it should be.</p><p>“Football has changed dramatically, and I think this group of players are a good young team and play a different brand of football than we did so let’s hope we can see a good performance from the Nigerian team.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FyZqytoJq%2FbrHAoKOeq12jvLV5zJqqrKGmmnqnrdWorKuhpJrAbrLOq2RraGJoeqKywqilZqWZoLKtec6boGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
