Enter Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan), an "antisocial," "total disaster" who Padgett decides is in need of a trendy makeover.</p><p>Because she updated Jordan's look when they first started dating, Padgett makes a bet with her friends, Alden (Madison Pettis) and Myra (Quinn), that she can use her skills to turn Cameron into a Prom King.</p><p>As Padgett spends more time with Cameron, she develops feelings for him. However, like in the original film, their burgeoning relationship is threatened when Cameron finds out that he's part of a bet.</p><p>The He's All That cast is rounded out with Rachael Leigh Cook, who plays Padgett's mom, Mrs. Sawyer. Though Rachael appears to be the only person from the original film to have a part in the reboot, she is not reprising the Laney Boggs role.</p><p>Kourtney Kardashian also has a cameo in He's All That, though it's unclear at this time whether she is playing herself or if she has a specific character.</p><p>"A little scruffy, but cute," Kourtney's on-screen persona says as she describes Cameron's look in the trailer.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'He's All That' release date is sooner than fans might expect.</h2><p>Those who are intrigued by the trailer won't have to wait too long to see the movie in its entirety.
