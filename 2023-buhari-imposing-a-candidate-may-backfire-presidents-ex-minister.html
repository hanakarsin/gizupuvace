We are a democratic party and the fact that some governors have in the past imposed candidates can not be a justification for us to continue to perpetuate anti-democratic (acts).</p><p>“They should not bamboozle people, they should not intimidate, they should not do anything that will compromise the right to fairness in bringing in new candidates.”</p><p>He further stated that the 2023 election would be different from the previous ones as there are stronger candidates on parade now.</p><p>Shittu said, “In 2019, it was essentially a two-party affair but this year, with what we have seen with the NNPP coming up, with Labour Party coming up with a very strong candidate in Peter Obi. We must appreciate that actions will naturally have consequences.</p><p>“We must learn from our circumstances, we must learn from our environment and know that it may not be as easy as we think.</p><p>“We must also be warned now that the youths are coming up, stronger and more agitated for change.</p><p>“We must be able to give the impression to the general public, particularly the youths, that we are being fair to all aspirants and that as democrats, as progressives, we are not giving the impression that some people are being overpampered above others.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e49qZmtoYmh6o8HHmqmiZZmivbC%2FyKeeZpldmK6vsMidmK2dXaKuunnBmpqknpmnsm680Z6qopyVo8G0ecSxZKahnp7AtbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
