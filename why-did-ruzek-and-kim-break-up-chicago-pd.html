They had to make significant sacrifices, but for a while, it seemed that they would be able to stay together forever.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>In an unforgettable episode, Ruzek went ahead and arranged an impromptu engagement proposal and popped the question in the workplace locker room.&nbsp;</p><p>Some naysayers dismissed the move as one that fundamentally lacks the romantic sentiments one would expect from Burgess's deserving suitor. Other fans applauded the spontaneous gesture because it marked the next big step for the couple.</p><p>"Burgess and Ruzek's engagement tho #ChicagoPDFinale," tweeted an enthusiastic fan.&nbsp;</p><p>"And Ruzek, I love him and Burgess, but please you don't throw engagement rings just like that," opined another person.&nbsp;</p><p>"#ChicagoPD It was so sweet Ruzek purpose to Burgess.
