Following the incident, the station ran several minutes of extended commercials before bringing on another host after the break.</p><p>In a tweet posted by Howie's family later on May 8, they provided an update on his condition and said that he was receiving treatment.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“Thank you for all your thoughts and prayer for Howie. During his show today, he fainted. He is getting care now and doing better," the tweet read.</p><p>According to local news outlet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston25</a>, one of Howie's grandchildren recently had norovirus and the virus spread to Howie, which is the reason for his fainting spell. They expect him to take a few more days away from the show but said that he'll make a full recovery.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Howie is part of the Conservative talk radio ecosystem.</h2><p>Although his audience is mostly confined to the fairly Liberal northeast, Howie is nonetheless known as an influential part of the Conservative talk radio ecosystem. He has been hosting a radio show since the 1980s, and has become an important part of many listeners' media diet in New England. Howie has also built up a substantial following, which is part of the reason so many people were freaked out by his health scare.</p><p>Howie has become closely aligned with former president Donald Trump, and has had him on his show more than a dozen times. Given their close relationship, it makes sense that Howie's influence has continued to grow in recent years. Howie also has plenty of influence over local Boston politics, and still writes a thrice-weekly column for the Boston Herald.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you for all all your thoughts and prayers for Howie.

This health scare could change that, but given the amount of influence Howie has accumulated over his decades on the airwaves, he may find it difficult to turn those reins over to someone else.</p><p>For now, it seems as though Howie will return to broadcasting as if nothing happened. Thankfully, his health scare was relatively minor one. He may not be able to continue doing this job indefinitely, but at least for now, fans don't have any reason to worry. Howie will be back giving his distinctly Conservative views on the air in no time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGShp6eesm6vwKup</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
