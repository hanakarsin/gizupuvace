However, some of them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">probably shouldn’t be consumed</a> by anyone. However, with every insane viral concoction comes a TikTok masterpiece that looks delicious, like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chicken cobbler recipe</a> that’s been making waves online.</p><p>Chicken cobbler is a modern take on chicken pot pie and includes a chain restaurant fave. If you’ve ever wondered how to make the recipe at home, we’ve got the details below!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The viral chicken cobbler on TikTok can be achieved with a small list of ingredients.</h2><p>While the term “cobbler” in the culinary world is typically associated with something sweet, TikToker Matthew Bounds (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@yourbarefootneighbor</a>) introduced his followers to a savory cobbler that they couldn’t resist.</p><p>The chicken cobbler has many aspects that remind folks of the homestyle cooking they likely had at some point in their lives. And thankfully, anyone can achieve the recipe with less than ten ingredients, and it seemingly doesn’t involve a massive cleanup at the end. Count us in!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In May 2023, Matthew posted how to make chicken cobbler. He shared the steps to make the recipe, which includes the following:</p><ul readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>One rotisserie chicken, shredded</p></li><li readability=-1><p>12-ounce bag of frozen peas and carrots (or your choice of vegetable)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>2 cups Red Lobster Cheddar Bay biscuit mix</p></li><li><p>2 cups milk</p></li><li><p>2 cups chicken stock</p></li><li readability=-1><p>10.5-ounce can cream of chicken soup</p></li><li><p>1 stick butter</p></li></ul><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Once you have your recipes in place, Matthew said in his video to melt the stick of butter at the bottom of a 9-by-13 glass pan as the oven preheats to 350 degrees. While the butter is melting, mix the biscuit batter, a seasoning packet that comes with the box, and any other seasoning you prefer.</p><p>After creating the batter, Matthew put the chicken and frozen vegetables in the cobbler and added the mix. He then begged his followers: “Don’t mix this s-t up.” Instead, leave the cobbler alone and allow it to become an oven. The TikToker added chicken stock and Campbell’s cream of chicken soup with herbs to finish the cobbler.</p><p>The final step is to keep the unmixed cobbler in the oven for 45 minutes. To avoid a watery consistency, once the cobbler is out of the oven, let it sit for 15 more minutes, and voila! You have a thick, delicious cobbler to enjoy!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Matthew Bounds?
