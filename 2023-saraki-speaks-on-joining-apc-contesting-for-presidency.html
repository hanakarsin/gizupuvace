I think that is not really fair. In 2015, I ran for the presidency and didn’t get it, but I offered myself to be the DG of Atiku, and I worked hard.</p><p>“I’m a team player; personal ambition is not what the issue is today; what is important is to get this country right. I have my children and grandchildren, and we must leave a better country with jobs for our talented youths. The fact that I said some people would defect does not mean I would defect.”</p><p>Saraki while answering questions noted that he would reveal his intention at the right time ahead of the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>The former Governor of Kwara State noted that he is currently focused on building a strong party and country.</p><p>He said: “What is important for any PDP member who truly loves the party and cares for the country is to have a party first.</p><p>“One of the reasons I took the responsibility of the National Reconciliation Committee was because there was a concern that the party was losing a lot of steam. Without a strong party, you can’t meet your individual ambition.</p><p>“As about last year, some individuals have already talked about their ambition for 2023, and I said it can’t be about ambition now, but we need to build a strong party.</p><p>“So, the focus for me now is for us to build a strong party, and we have started the process in our congresses, reconciliation, and hopefully the convention.</p><p>“After we have put that in place, then we can start talking about individual interests. In due time I would love to respond when I’m ready.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FvZmtoYmh6tK3RmqKiZaOlsqK30mamp2WapLavtc2gZJqok2KwsLrTnqqtoZ6ceqe70Wanq52jnrGmusKyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
