Another adds, “We owe the people who have asked for our help to actually do something.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Jehovah’s Witnesses a cult? What do they believe in?&nbsp;</h2><p>According to their official website, the group insists it is “far from being a dangerous cult.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jehovah’s Witnesses, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boast</a> 8.3 million followers and nearly 120,000 congregations, are mainly known to the mainstream for their door-to-door attempts at evangelizing and converting non-believers.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Others associate the faith with their lack of parties and celebrations. Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t observe national holidays, Christian holidays based around Jesus, or even birthdays. They also don't pledge allegiance to the flag and look down on celebrations of "apostasy," i.e., elevating worldly occurrences to the same level as God.</p><p>Many others note their controversial views about medical help, for example how they “don’t accept blood transfusions because the Bible forbids taking in blood to sustain the body” — even when the situation is life or death — a matter that recently caused the group to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">banned</a> as an extremist organization in Russia.&nbsp;They also don't eat food with blood for this reason, and many devout Jehovah's Witnesses are consequently vegetarian.</p><p>But there’s more to this religious group that branched off from orthodox Christianity in the late 1800s. For one, it came out of the Bible Student movement, when founder Charles Taze Russell began to dispute some of Christianity’s traditional views and published a magazine called Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence to flesh out his concepts. In fact, before settling on a name taken from the Tetragrammaton (YHWH/JHVH), the group was originally called the Watch Tower Society after Charles’ publication.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses use a Bible different from other Christians called the New World Translation and believe, at the core of their faith, that Jesus was created by God and is not equal or coexistent with him. Therefore they neither worship Jesus, the Trinity, or the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;They also hold a central tenant of the 144,000 anointed, meaning that there are only that many spots (to account for all of history!) in heaven while the remaining devout would live out eternity on Earth after Armageddon. However, that Earth would resemble a restoration of the Garden of Eden.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are many celebrity Scientologists. Are there any famous Jehovah’s Witnesses?</h2><p>Though Scientology pretty much has dibs on celebrities and has even opened “Celebrity Center” churches for their most famous members, Jehovah’s Witnesses also have devout members whose names may ring a bell.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Most famously, Michael Jackson was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, and though most of his siblings are no longer practicing, the Jackson family matriarch <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been raising</a> Michael’s children in the religion.</p><p>“Purple Rain” musician Prince is also known for his association with Jehovah’s Witnesses, having converted in 2001 following his mother’s death. Other notable Jehovah’s Witnesses are Serena Williams and sister Venus, who were raised in the faith, as well as Naomi Campbell, Patti Smith, Michelle Rodriguez, The Notorious B.I.G, and even Dwight D. Eisenhower, who were all born into the religion but later left it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What aspects of the Jehovah's Witnesses will Leah Remini explore in her show?</h2><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Leah will most likely look at Jehovah’s Witnesses through her personal lens of having left Scientology, a press release for her special describes Jehovah’s Witnesses as working to “subvert and exploit belief.” We imagine she’ll probably look into the religion’s unconventional practices, some of which are similar to Scientology’s, and expose some of the alleged cover-ups of sexual abuse the group has been recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marred</a> by.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And former Jehovah’s Witnesses, as well as some current practitioners, can hardly wait until November 13th.</h2><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“My Jehovah’s Witness mom is actually the one who told me about the show,” said one woman on CrassYoungPeople’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a>, “Reclaiming Our Time with Leah Remini.” She continues, “She said, ‘I’m very interested because I want to know what the actual issues are.’ Even regular witnesses, somebody like my mom who is very removed from the internal politics, who is not interested in the disputes about doctrine … even she is becoming more and more privy to what’s going on, the more dangerous aspects, which is really interesting … Shows like this are really important for … people who don’t really understand Jehovah’s Witnesses, who don’t understand their teaching and how dangerous and life-threatening their doctrine is.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>An EX-JW who participates in the very active reddit group for former Jehovah’s Witnesses members wrote of their excitement about the upcoming special: “It will be movie night at our house. Can’t wait for Leah Remini’s special to air, and yes my children will be watching with me. I will help them understand how this FAMILY BREAKING CORPORATION operates and they will understand why certain family members do not talk to me and just act like my kids don’t exist. Got popcorn ready. We are waiting for November. And my glass of [wine], of course.”</p><p>Don’t miss Leah Remini’s special on Jehovah’s Witnesses on November 13th at 9PM on A&E.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZqaF9ofnCmkaaJjX57ZLmmrcdmqZ6lmaO2brbEoaavmZhixKrAzZ6qrJ2j</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
