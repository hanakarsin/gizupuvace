It is right that Nigerians speak up in difficult situations.</p><p>“And the government has been doing everything possible to alleviate those concerns.</p><p>“But we also want to separate the legitimate concerns being expressed by some of the labour unions from people trying to leverage some of the situations in the country to achieve a political agenda.</p><p>“We have seen the Trade Union Congress (TUC) pull out of the purported nationwide protest. We have seen the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) pull out of the protest. There is no unanimity behind what NLC is trying to do.</p><p>“I believe all of the legitimate concerns being raised by the unions are being tackled by the administration of President Bola Tinubu.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FwZqmqlai2pbHNnLBmq6Carqy%2FjJqkopyjqXqvrdOipqevmZmybrzRqKueq6Rk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
