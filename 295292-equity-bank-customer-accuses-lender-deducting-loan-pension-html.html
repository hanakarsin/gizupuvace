He called customer care and after unsuccessful resets, one of your (Equity's) representatives advised him to go to his branch in Limuru and get his pin changed...He pays a visit to Equity Limuru branch. First point of contact is the customer Service desk. Dad is of course his respectful self. The bank official, not so much," Mathia claimed.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: KSh 7 billion corruption scandal hits Ministry of Health</strong></p><p class=align-left>Mathia's father reportedly<strong> </strong>shared the problem he had with Equitel line with the bank and he was immediately told the line he was talking about was not his and that he should instead disclose to the bank where he got it from.</p>"Kindly note this is a line that matches his Safaricom line, which he has had forever. Back and forth and they finally sort things out by renewing the SIM card," Mathia said.<p class=align-left>And that was just the beginning of this particular customer's troubles with the bank. Going by the detailed account of events given by Mathia, the old man's worst nightmare was yet to come.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Equity Bank records KSh 11 billion profit after tax in half year results</strong></p><p class=align-left>Mathia narrated when her father returned home from Limuru and inserted his renewed Equitel line, a series of messages he was not expecting started trickling in.</p>"On getting home, Dad got a message that he had an outstanding loan of KSh 34,000 and then notifications for repayment with a deadline of December 27, 2018, started coming through, thick and fast as Jeff would say," Mathia recounted.<p class=align-left>Feeling unsettled and confused by the rather strange loan, which he had absolutely no recollection of ever borrowing, the old man returned to the bank to seek answers.</p>"He went back to the bank obviously emphatic that he had no such loan. The bank manager was exceptionally rude and liberally mistreated my dad till he wondered what he could possibly have done to offend the manager so much," Mathia claimed.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: List of government institutions, ministries which have been rocked with multi-million corruption scandals</strong></p><p class=align-left>The said rude manager was expected to give the customer a complaint form to fill for escalation and action, but that, Mathia claimed, did not happen.</p>"Dad went there three times asking for that form. The manager threw him out telling him to go report to the police and bring the OB number. Well, Dad did exactly that. He went and reported to the police and emailed the complaint and OB Number. The matter was assigned an incident report number by the bank," Mathia narrated.<p class=align-left>Then came the biggest shocker.</p><p class=align-left>When the old man's pension for the month of December 2018 hit his Equity Bank account, it was allegedly deducted in its entirety to pay the KSh 34,000 loan mentioned above.</p>"He continues to receive notifications for the balance...Yeah it’s disturbing how small pensions can be after decades of working. I have so many questions and this whole matter is extremely upsetting but what infuriates me is the lack of empathy by Equity," Mathia lamented.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Equity Bank records KSh 11 billion profit after tax in half year results</strong></p><p class=align-left>According to the aggrieved customer's daughter, the retirement cash that was deposited in his Equity Bank account was being withdrawn through another number.</p>"The guy actually withdrew KSh 34,000, checked balance, got a message that there was KSh 300 remaining and withdrew KSh 200 bob. It has also been established that Dad was on an active call at the exact time the transaction was happening and at a very different location...How do you take up an individual's entire pension to pay a disputed loan with such glaring evidence!!!??? As big as you are ! Could you not flag the account to stop the automatic deduction? What’s with your Limuru Branch bank manager? And his staff? Why are they acting so weird??? Do they know something???" Mathia posed.<p class=align-left>Reacting to the allegations raised by Mathia against Equity Bank, several other Facebook users claimed they were also victims of similar incidents of fraud at the bank.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Osman Mohamed G said:</a> "I have another sad experience with Equity Bank. My wife withdrew KSh 30,000 from ATM in Isiolo Branch. She never received the money but the amount was deducted from her account. It was a holiday and the bank was closed, so we reported the following day to mbt branch and the matter was never resolved. When she asked Isiolo Branch, they said that they have reconciled and we received the cash..."<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ndaiga Thango said</a>: "I also suffered a case of withdrawal of KSh 6000 at Kangema Equity....and they did nothing about it up to date."<p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Doris G Kithinji</a> said: "A friend of mine lost KSh 700,000 from their so called Equitel .NKT!!!"</p>Eve Kiletia said: "Something is amiss here...My mum's KSh 200,000 clean got cleared from her Equity account na wanasema (and they said) it's through her Equitel line that the money was withdrawn yet she's had the line all through. Hadi saai (Up to date) the money hasn't been recovered.... What's going on??"<p class=align-left>These were just some of the many disturbing allegations levelled against the tier one lender.</p><p class=align-left>For the avoidance of any doubt on just how big the lender is, the bank was in October 2018 ranked in the top 50 most stable banks in the world in terms of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), a measure of a bank's financial stability.</p><p class=align-left>It emerged 35th globally and first in Kenya as the most financially stable bank according to The Banker Magazine's annual report of the top 1000 banks in the world.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: 400200 Coop Bank Paybill - MPESA to Cooperative Bank</strong></p><p class=align-left>TUKO.co.ke on Friday, January 4, contacted Equity Bank to seek answers on some of the allegations raised and most of which were doing rounds on social media.</p><p class=align-left>The bank requested that we send them an email with the questions we wanted answered.</p><p class=align-left>The bank's communications team was yet to respond by the time this story was published.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a hot story or scandal you would like us to publish, please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690 and Telegram: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tuko news.</a></i></strong></p><p class=align-left>Small Business Ideas for Kenyans With Low Investment - On Tuko TV</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BmG5pcmpdmr62tdOyZJuZnqB6pMHSraamnaJirqSv1KycrGWcmrulsdFmm56cpZjBqrrGZqOomZ5ivaa60qKmp2aYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
