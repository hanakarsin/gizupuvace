After his Law School, he reapplied through the same means for reinstatement to complete his service;</p><p>“We discovered a temporary file was used for reference. That means his initial file could not be traced;</p><p>“NYSC provided the six-series certificate, which was signed and collected by corps members, and the eight series;</p><p>“We discovered that the numbers are in series. But NYSC could not account for 12 certificates, among which includes Mbah’s certificate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, during cross-examination, LP lead counsel, Chief Adegoke Awomolo (SAN), observed that the report presented by the DSS official did not come with the letterhead and stamps of the security agency as against the usual practice and sought to know the reason from Mohammed, to which he responded that his signature sufficed.</p><p>Also, responding to why he did not come to the court with authorizing letter or directive by the Director General of the DSS, Mohammed said he appeared in court because of the subpoena.</p><p>Furthermore, Mohammed said the attached document backing the report was in the office.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) earlier on Wednesday failed to present any witness to defend the allegation by the candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Chijioke Edeoga, that the 2023 governorship election that produced Peter Mbah as governor was manipulated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FpZp6mpZzCbsDRopmuppGheqW%2F0maip6eToMBuutismmanppq%2Fbr%2FHqJudsV2eu7ex0q2goJmknryvedKasKxlnZeuqb%2BMnJyrrJmbtqSt055kmq2knbKvwMeimmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
