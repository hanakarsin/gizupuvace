We have now seen that the government is saying that they want to spend N3 billion to audit the social register, which is scandalous. What are you spending N3 billion to audit? It’s embarrassing, some of the things we hear in this country.</p><p>“So, I am saying that these social intervention schemes or programmes should be scrapped. It has not altered the poverty ratio in the country, it has not had any effect on inflation, it does not improve the purchasing power of the Nigerian people, let us scrap it completely,” Effiong said.</p><p>A prominent figure in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abayomi Nurain Mumuni, has called on Nigerians to support the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in its ongoing investigation into the alleged misappropriation of N583 million by the suspended Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Betta Edu.</p><p>In a statement released to journalists over the weekend by his media aide, Rasheed Abubakar, Mumuni emphasized the importance of allowing the EFCC to conduct its investigations without public interference.</p><p>This comes in light of the controversy surrounding the suspension of Edu, who is accused of diverting a substantial amount of government funds into a private account.</p><p>Mumuni also addressed the suspension of the minister by President Bola Tinubu, calling for restraint in public discussions about the president’s decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FsZp6ek5h6ra3TnqqtZZKawbWtjJ6brmWemsS0edSpm5qslah6sLqMoaymmZ6ewaK%2ByJqlZqWZo7a0wNGyZKybkaOxoriMn6arZZqWu25%2BkqubZmpgZ4Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
