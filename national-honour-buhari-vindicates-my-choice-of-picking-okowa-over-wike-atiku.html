On behalf of my family, our team and our supporters, I say congratulations.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Atiku had received knocks from party stakeholders after picking the Delta State governor as his running mate, leaving behind Rivers State Governor <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong> who emerged second behind him at the PDP’s national convention and presidential primaries months ago.</p><p>Atiku’s choice of Okowa over Wike is counted as one of the major Genesis of the yet unsolved crisis rocking the nation’s major opposition camp.</p><p>A few months before the 2023 general elections, Wike and four other governors elected on the platform of the PDP, including some party chieftains have openly shown their displeasure with the leadership of the party and activities going on in preparation for the February 2023 polls, <strong>Naija News</strong> understands.</p><p>Recently, the party chieftains boycotted the kickoff of the Atiku/Okowa presidential campaign in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Aside from the anger over Atiku’s choice of making Okowa his running mate, the party stakeholders are also demanding the resignation of the PDP National Chairman, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Iyorchia Ayu.</strong></a></p><p>The developments have since caused an internal crisis in the opposition party seeking to unseat the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BrZqeZpJ68r63LZp%2Bopp%2Bqv26u1KGYq6Fdq7avsMicmK2do2K6unnCoaaim5VivKd5z6KapKGenHqwt86wmGanppq%2FbsPIpJxmmaSeuLZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
