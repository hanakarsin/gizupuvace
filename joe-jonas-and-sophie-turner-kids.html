Their eldest daughter, Willa, was born in July 2020.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Sophie gave birth to the couple's second daughter in 2022. It's unclear which month, but the news was confirmed in July 2022. Joe and Sophie have not disclosed the name of their second daughter to the public.</p><p>Sophie actually revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle U.K.</a> in May 2022 that she and Joe try very hard not to be obnoxious about their own red carpet appearances, saying, "You never want to market yourself as a celebrity couple. It's not that cool. And my daughter never asked for any of this."</p><p>She went on to explain that she never intends to force her daughter to live life in the public sphere "unless she says, 'This is what I want to do.'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by S O P H I E T U R N E R (@sophiet)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sophie pleaded with fans for privacy after posting video of Willa.</h2><p>After accidentally sharing a video of Willa on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> page in May 2023, per People, Sophie deleted the video right away and wrote to fans:</p><p>"We have always advocated for our kids' rights to privacy so sharing this publicly is something that is against anything I stand for. Our children deserve the right to grow up out of the public eye, to learn and grow in private. If I ever were to post anything of our kids, know that it is unquestionably a mistake."</p><p>While Joe and Sophie typically keep quiet about their kids, what they do choose to reveal to the public about their family is downright heartwarming.</p><p>For example, Sophie revealed on The Wrap's UnWrapped podcast (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>) in May 2022 that becoming a mother helped her up her acting game.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by S O P H I E T U R N E R (@sophiet)</a></p></figure><p>She explained, "As an actor, the only way to become a really brilliant actor is to experience as much life as possible and to bring those experiences in, and so this is just another little part of life that I'm experiencing that I get to bring in and hopefully it helps my performance one way or another."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ymecmopZqrXZa7pXnSqKehoZViwba%2BzZ6pZqOZmcA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
