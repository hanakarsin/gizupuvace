This will not be possible without the support of the federal government.</p><p>“The service chiefs are giving us the desired cooperation. Indeed, the current theatre commander and the GOCs have been giving their cooperation.</p><p>“Honestly speaking, we have to do something about the operations of ISWAP in Borno state. If nothing is done to check them and chase them out, it may be bad not only for people of the North East, but the entire nation at large.</p><p>“ISWAP’s fighters are better armed, better equipped, more intelligent and more sophisticated than Boko Haram and they grow spontaneously. Hence, the need to pursue the ISWAP now.”</p><p>Speaking on behalf of the committee, its Chairman, <strong>Senator Ali Ndume</strong>, said the visit to Borno was to commend Zulum for his support to the army towards restoring peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5BrZqehl5q%2Fqq2MpqCloaSWv7p50qGmrqSUYrOwr9SsZKimXZ7AuK3PZp2in5ipsrO%2FjKemrWWSpLiweceaqZqlXa%2FCrcHMaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
