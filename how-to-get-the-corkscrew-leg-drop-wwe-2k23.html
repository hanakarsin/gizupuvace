You’ll first need to make sure this is your current objective – if you don’t see it displayed on the side of your screen, keep working through your objective list until it shows up. Once the corkscrew leg drop objective is listed, you can go ahead and perform the action. Here’s how it works.</p><ul><li>This objective requires John Cena to be outside of the ring and leaning on either the North or South Barricade.</li><li>To get him there, you’ll need to toss him out of the ring.</li><li>Once outside, bring him towards the middle of the north or south guardrails that surround the ring.</li></ul><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><ul><li>If you’re having trouble positioning John, you can grapple him (defaults to "B" on Xbox) and hold "LB" to drag them into position. Be sure to get him leaning up against the railing. If he’s lying on the ground or standing up stunned, you won’t be able to properly perform the action.</li><li>Next, you’ll need to press the grapple button. This should automatically toss John halfway over the rail and send RVD up to the ring to perform the corkscrew leg drop.</li></ul><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Once this is done, you’ll be able to continue on with your match. Keep in mind that you don’t necessarily have to complete this objective, and pinning Cena at almost anytime will result in a victory. But if you want to hit 100% completion of the Showcase mode, you’ll have to perform the dreaded corkscrew leg drop.</p><p>To make things easier on yourself, consider wearing down Cena before attempting this challenge. Getting him out of the ring and into position while he’s near full health is difficult. That means you can spend a few minutes attacking him to lower his health or inflict limb damage to make him easier to maneuver around the ring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGLBqbGMnKaro6OYv6bDjKWcoGWUp7yxedawnGZqm2eA</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
