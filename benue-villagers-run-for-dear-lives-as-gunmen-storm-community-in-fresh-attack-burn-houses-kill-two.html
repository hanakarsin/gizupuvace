Two bodies have so far been recovered. Many houses were burnt. In fact, within the attacked community yesterday in the night, at least 17 burnt houses were counted,” Oche said,</p><p>He added that residents of the affected communities had deserted their homes.</p><p>Confirming the attack, a former Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Mike Inalegwu, who hails from the local government, said tension was high in the council area.</p><p>He said, “The truth is that yesterday (Tuesday) the armed herdsmen attacked Okpokpolo village and killed two persons while the villagers were thinking of their speculative attack on the Ogbai community.</p><p>“Tension is high and the seven villages in Kogi border of the local government are deserted. This is authoritative.”</p><p>The Special Adviser to Governor Hyacinth Alia on Security and Internal Affairs, Joseph Har, also confirmed the attack. He however said he was not told that people were killed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FuZpudnqqybsLIpaOan5WnwG6%2B1Kdkn6eiYrGmrdFmo6Kulah6or%2BMoKynpZWjerTAzqukZpuforq2usitsGahnmKzs7HSoWSarKSWsKx5wa6pp2WYpMK0sdJmoqKknGLBuLuO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
