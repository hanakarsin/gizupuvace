There is no doubt that the PDP won that election but unfortunately, we were cheated out of the election. As we move into another election, we are confident that if all of us stay committed to the party, that we will be able to deliver the victory for our party.”</p><p>Apart from the Osun governorship polls, he urged members of the PDP to rally around and support the party’s presidential candidate for the 2023 election, Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>He said “God has gone ahead of the party,” but members need to play their roles since the party has realized its mistakes which allowed the APC to push it out of power in 2015.</p><p>“We believe that we are able to redeem Nigeria, rescue it and begin a process of rebuilding this nation. Yes, we were in office and made some mistakes. We have learnt our lessons, we have apologised to Nigerians. We’re coming back as a rebranded PDP and we are going to entrench democracy,” Okowa pointed out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5JpZqirpaN6c3yRa2Soo5%2Bsrm6zyK%2BcrGWgmb1uv9OrmK2dl656tbuMnZyfnZGpeqK8wmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
