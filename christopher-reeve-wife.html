To the general population, he's mostly known as Superman. Christopher's charisma, humanitarian efforts, and a tremendous talent made his early death a tragic loss, but thankfully, he has family members to keep his memory alive."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And where are his kids now? Read on for everything we know about the Reeve family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christopher Reeve's wife, Dana, passed away shortly after he did.</h2><p>In 1995, Christopher broke his neck after being thrown from his horse during a competition. As a result, he spent the last years of his life paralyzed from the waist down, although this did not stop his creative or activist pursuits. He directed In the Gloaming, appeared in a television remake of Rear Window, and even made cameos on the CW hit Smallville.</p><p>Christopher lobbied for spinal injury research, including human embryonic stem cell research, and better insurance coverage for people with disabilities. He also co-founded <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation</a> and the Reeve-Irvine Research Center. Unfortunately, Christopher died in October 2004, just before his 52nd birthday.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>During his lifetime, Christopher had two primary partners: Gae Exton, a British modeling executive, and his late wife Dana Reeve (neé Morosini). Christopher had three children: Matthew Exton Reeve, an activist, Alexandra Exton Reeve, and William Reeve. While Christopher and Gae had split by 1987 but remained amicable, he married Dana, a singer, in 1992.</p><p>After Christopher passed away, Dana took charge of their foundation, the Christopher Reeve Foundation. A year later, in 2005, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, despite being a non-smoker all her life. She died at age 44 in 2006, and the foundation was subsequently named after her as well, making it the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where are Christopher Reeve's children now? They have carried on his legacy.</h2><p>Currently, all of Christopher's children serve on the board of directors for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. Of the three children, Matthew has followed his father's footsteps into entertainment. He produced and directed the 2002 documentary about Christopher, Christopher Reeve: Hope in Motion, as well as a follow-up film after his father's death. He released Over The Water, a documentary about World Champion kiteboarder Aaron Hadlow that Matthew wrote, directed, and filmed in 2009.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Will Reeve (@willreeve_)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In 2015, Alexandra reportedly named her son after her late father: Christopher Russell Reeves.
