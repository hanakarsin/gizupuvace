His ability to slide into a comedy and then over to a horror movie before dipping into a criminal-activities procedural is partially why he's stayed working for over three decades. Also, his rugged good looks aren't hurting him in the slightest. Now that he's <a href=#>joining CBS's FBI: Most Wanted</a>, we're very curious about his net worth after all these years. Let's get into it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Dylan McDermott's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Dylan is worth an estimated $20 million. Let's see how he got there.</p><p>It was Dylan's father's third wife, Eve Ensler (writer of The Vagina Monologues), who convinced Dylan that acting was his calling. Though they divorced, Dylan remained close to Eve and credits her with this acting career. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> in 2007 that "she was that person who changed [his] life utterly and completely." Eve would often write small parts for Dylan in her own plays.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Dylan, whose birth name is Mark Anthony McDermott, took on the name Dylan after Eve suffered a miscarriage. Dylan was going to be the name of her child.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Dylan McDermott</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Actor</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $20 million</p><p><strong>Birth date:</strong> October 26, 1961</p><p><strong>Birth place:</strong> Waterbury, Connecticut</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> Mark Anthony McDermott</p><p><strong>Father</strong>: Richard McDermott</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Diane McDermott (birth), Eve Ensler (adopted)</p><p><strong>Marriages: </strong>Shiva Rose‚Äã‚Äã (m. 1995; div. 2009)</p><p><strong>Children</strong>: Colette Rose McDermott, Charlotte Rose McDermott</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Fordham University, BA</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dylan's first major role was the 1987 war film Hamburger Hill, which he starred in alongside heavy hitters like Courtney B. Vance, <a href=#>Don Cheadle</a>, and Steven Weber. In 1989, he landed his first role in a major motion picture in a little film called Steel Magnolias.</p><p>Despite having a minor role as the husband to Julia Roberts, it was nearly impossible not to notice Dylan, which is why his big break with Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire (1993) was the perfect part for the up-and-coming actor. In the movie, Dylan plays a Secret Service Agent which was the first of many times he would step into the polished shoes of a character in law enforcement or some government agency. He has the perfect jawline for those parts.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Meeting Clint Eastwood while filming In the Line of Fire is what led Dylan to his first TV acting gig in David E. Kelly's courtroom drama The Practice, for which he won a Golden Globe. He played defense attorney Bobby Donnell from 1997 to 2004, until he was let go due to budgeting issues. A few years later, Dylan hit the horror movie circuit with The Messengers (2007). The movie itself was interesting but was made more memorable by the fact that his daughter was played by Academy Award nominee/former vampire, <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>His career is fascinating because Dylan would find parts in rather unorthodox movies like The Perks of Being a Wallflower or the teen sex comedy Behaving Badly, while still carving out a significant space on television. The Dylan McDermott train really pulled into the station when he appeared in Season 1 (as well as Seasons 2, 8, and 9) of Ryan Murphy's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Horror Story</a>. That first season is widely considered the best, and Dylan McDermott was integral to its success.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the dylan mcdermott who plays ernie in hollywood is the same dylan mcdermott in american horror story? wHAT? i've been obsessing over both characters not knowing they're the same person????</p>‚Äî ùó∏ (@pattinstonex) <a href=#>September 22, 2020</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmcatrc1mpJyclae6sMDTZqWerF2svLPAxw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
