However, as he revealed in an additional video, this hasn't always been the case.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I'm very competitive, I like to win. I don't like to lose," Tre described his modus operandi in an Instagram video.&nbsp;</p><p>"I used to play college football. I loved every single bit of it. Just to make it up to the college level was just a dream come true. People would most likely label me as a player and they're correct [...] I'm honest. [...] I'm a changed man now though!" he explained.</p><p>As Tre explained, he realized that it was time to revise his approach toward dating after spending the past four years flying solo.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Getting to know Tré ⚡️ "It's Love Island, it's not ____ _________."

I told myself that the next girl that I'm with I'm going to make sure that I'm all in, so if I go on here and meet an attractive girl who has a really good vibe and I connect with her then the sky is the limit. She may end up being my girlfriend or something long term, she may be my wife, who knows," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Tre describes himself as a high flier, it's uncertain how well this will translate in the context of Love Island USA. The show was launched only recently, and the contestants haven't had the chance to get to know each other all that well just yet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tre used to play football for Ohio State Buckeyes.</h2><p>Tre claims that playing competitive sports on a college-level has born a significant influence on his approach to everyday life, including his dating philosophy.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">247sports.com</a>, Tre joined Ohio State Buckeyes in 2013. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>, however, he reportedly left the team after only five games.
