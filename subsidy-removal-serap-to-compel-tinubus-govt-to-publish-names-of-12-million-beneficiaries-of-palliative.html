This measure is designed to lessen the hardships caused by subsidy removal.</p><p>In a letter to the House of Representatives, read out by Speaker Tajudeen Abbas, President Tinubu described the financial assistance as a means for poor and vulnerable Nigerians to meet basic needs.</p><p>The letter requested approval for additional funding for the National Social Safety Net Program, a measure previously expanded by the National Assembly. The president suggested that this could positively impact around 60 million people.</p><p>This platform also recalls that Tinubu on Thursday sought Senate’s approval for $800 million loan to finance the National Social Safety Network Programme.</p><p>President Tinubu, in a letter addressed to the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, which was read to lawmakers on the floor of the Senate, said the fund would be used to scale up the National Social Safety Net Programme.</p><p>He said the fund would be borrowed from the World Bank, noting that to ensure the credibility of the process, digital transfers will be made directly to beneficiaries’ accounts and mobile wallets.</p><p>In the latter, Tinubu noted that “You may further wish to note that under the conditional cash transfer window of the programme, the federal government of Nigeria will transfer the sum of ₦8,000 per month to 12 million poor and low-income households for a period of six months, with a multiplier effect on about 60 million individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;“In order to guarantee the credibility of the process, digital transfers will be made directly to beneficiaries’ accounts and mobile wallets.</p><p>“It is expected that the programme will stimulate economic activities in the informal sector and improve nutrition, health, education, and human capital development of beneficiaries’ households.</p><p>“Given the above, I wish to invite the Senate to kindly grant approval for the additional loan facility of $800 million to be secured from World Bank for the National Social Safety Net Programme.”</p><p>Reacting to the development, SERAP took to its handle on the micro-blogging platform Twitter to disclose that it would issue a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to compel the President to publish the details of how the fund would be disbursed.</p><p>SERAP, on its Twitter handle @SERAPNigeria, wrote: “We’re issuing an FoI request to compel the Tinubu administration to publish details of proposed transfer of ₦8,000 monthly to 12 million poor households for six months, such as the list of intended beneficiaries, how they will be selected, and the methods of payments.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BsZqytkqi2pcWMq5ymp6aWuW6%2FxKuYqWWkpHqku8ypnKVlpJ67tq7UrGSgp6aperW7jKmsm6SZqLVuusCmnKxln5t6cn6MpqClpJmku26uxKecn6GTnq6ztcSsZKieXaWurbjImquirpVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
