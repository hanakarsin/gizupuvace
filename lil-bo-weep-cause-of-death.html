The Australian rapper was best known for her song "Codependency," which has been streamed millions of times on Spotify. In a post on Facebook, Winona's father said that she had battled PTSD and addiction throughout her life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>"This weekend we lost the fight for my daughter’s life against depression,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote</a>. “She is no longer struggling anymore with the universe wanting their angel back."</p><p>He also referred to Winona as his "best friend" and a "hero." No official cause of death has been released yet, and it's unclear whether one will ever be released to the public.

I love you," one commenter wrote, with many others adding similar sentiments.</p><p>It's clear that many fans of Winona's will feel her loss acutely, even as they try to discover what exactly happened to her. Many may speculate, but it's clear that whatever Winona's cause of death, her death itself is a tragedy. Hopefully, her fans can respect her family's privacy in its aftermath.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobatecGoZLCdlaV6pK3UrJxmp5Zisaat06E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
