We are committed to taking the right steps to achieve the desired results.</p><p>“The acquisition of these aircraft amongst other military equipment despite our budgetary constraints is an expression of our commitment. We shall ensure that every sector of our nation benefits from the change that we promised. I therefore expect discipline in operation and a strong maintenance culture that will enable the nation to derive maximum benefits from these acquisitions</p><p>“This is indeed most commendable just as the Nigerian Air Force continues to synergize with other security agencies in curtailing the threats posed by terrorists, insurgents and other criminal elements in the country.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_9905.jpeg alt width=2048 height=1364 sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Recalling his promise during his inaugural speech last year that security shall be the top priority of his administration, the President said about six months after his proclamations, “So much has been achieved due to the gallant and synergistic efforts of our various security agencies”.</p><p>He expressed delight that coordination among security agencies has improved significantly, just as he declared that “there is no room for celebrations until we put an end to the security logjam; until we can bring our troops back to their localities, and until we can free up resources for our critical economic expansion programme”.</p><p>President Tinubu assured that professionalism, capacity building and adequate equipping of the Armed Forces and other security agencies are a major policy thrust of his administration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49vZqyslaV6tryMsqauql2crq6xjK2mZp2emXqqutKemq6qmanGbsDIp6ybrV2psq240makoqSZqa6zxYysnJytop7BunnAoJynm5mawHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
