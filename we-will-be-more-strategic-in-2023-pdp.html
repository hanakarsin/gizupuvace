That is democracy. On paper, that is the best the party could do. However, we all know that only a few of those aspirants identified with the Atiku/Obi ticket. They kept sealed lips when it was necessary for them to speak up and that didn’t help us.</p><p>“I don’t want to move faster than the Governor Bala Mohammed-led committee that is reviewing the performance of our party in that election. What you cannot, however, gloss over is the fact that some governors whose names I won’t mention here failed to do the necessary mobilization in their respective states. This gave the All Progressives Congress, APC, an easy job in those states and we got punished.</p><p>“Now, I gathered, that was not entirely the fault of those governors. Some of them felt they weren’t given the liberty to champion the campaign as they deemed fit and decided to let those who branded themselves experts in electioneering matters to take centre stage. We learned belatedly what mileage that cost us at the end.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5BpZrCdXay2rbiMm5xmpZ%2Bnsm6%2F06uYrZ2XnrButc1maWlqY2K9pbyO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
