She was born in 1994, has been songwriting since she was a preteen, and released a single in 2016 called "Strong, Sweet and Southern." Additionally, Haley sang background vocals for Demi Lovato on Disney's Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam soundtrack and for Miley Cyrus on Disney's Hannah Montana Forever soundtrack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But as judge <a href=#>Nicole Scherzinger</a> guessed, Ringmaster could have been <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a>, who got her start on the Disney Channel.
