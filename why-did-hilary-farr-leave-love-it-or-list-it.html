It doesn't matter what my mom is doing, if Love It or List It appears on her television, she always stop to watch. She loves it. With so many home renovation and/or flip it shows to choose from, it's easy to see why this one has lasted for 15 years and remains popular.</p><p>Beyond the fact that Hilary and her co-host <a href=#>David Visentin</a> are incredibly good at what they do, it's their relationship that keeps viewers glued to the screen. They joke, bicker, and lovingly poke fun at each other in a way that is familiar to anyone who has a best friend. This begs the question, why is Hilary Farr leaving Love It or List It and who will David tease now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@hilary_farr</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Hilary leaving 'Love It or List It?' Sometimes ya gotta list it.</h2><p>In an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a>, Hilary shared that it was simply time to "move on and meet new challenges." The <a href=#>home designer</a> has happily dedicated much of her life to the show, and is beyond grateful the experience. "t's got me through hard times. It's got the audiences through hard times. It has evolved into a mainstay of people's lives and it's been incredibly gratifying," she told the outlet.</p><p>Although this may come as a shock to fans, Hilary knew this was coming for quite some time. In fact, she made the difficult decision at the end of Season 19. "I realized that everything that I am as a woman, which is [that I] look for challenges, look for inspiration, look for new ideas, be excited about all the possibilities that are out there, had really needed to bloom and to find their way," Hilary said. "I told everyone I'm done."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What will happen to David and the show once Hilary is gone?</h2><p>To live in a world where there is a David but no Hilary is like asking us to have a sun without the moon, or peanut butter without jelly. At the risk of being dramatic, it hardly seems possible. After telling David that she wasn't coming back, Hilary said he didn't believe her. "Oh, you say that," he said to her. Honestly, Hilary had trouble believing it herself.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Hilary Farr and David Visentin are seen outside the Today show on September 16, 2019 in New York City.</p></figure><p>When Season 20 began filming, multiple people asked if she was coming back. "I thought that everyone had accepted it, but they hadn't," said Hilary. Take a number, we are struggling as well. Unfortunately, this is not a bad dream. HIlary patiently explained to folks on the show, "With all the love in the world, the answer was no. It's just time."</p><p>It's not often that two people who work so closely together, develop an actual friendship outside of the "office," but that's precisely what happened between David and Hilary. "We are who we are [in real life] on that show. Think of your brother as his most obnoxious and annoying, that's David," she told PEOPLE. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 which resulted in three lumpectomies and radiation, David was there. Hilary doesn't see that changing.</p><p>When it comes to the show, Hilary is also certain it will go on. As of the time of this writing, a new co-host has yet to be announced but she is absolutely rooting for them. "I wish them all the luck in the world,” Hilary said. "And I would probably tune in and watch it." If you need a Hilary fix in a post-Love It or List It world, she will still be hosting Tough Love with Hilary Farr which the designer says she "enjoys in a different way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2agmaGus8WMn5irql2hsqLCxGajqK6VYra1ec6rZKWho6l6qsA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
