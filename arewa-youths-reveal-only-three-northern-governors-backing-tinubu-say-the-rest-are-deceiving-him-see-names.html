The body language of the governors other than those that have demonstrated the willingness to do it right like Mattawalle, Yahaya Bello, and El-Rufai, others are just paying lip services.</p><p>“They are just paying lip service that they would promise but fail; apart from these governors I mentioned, the other APC governors are not harmonizing anything even in their state.</p><p>“The APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, should realize that they are not serious or trying to let him down. Relying on only governors this time around would not help matters; he should go down and meet leaders of stakeholders of various groups and work with them so that when the chips are down, the governors will be left with no choice but to come back.</p><p>“Some of them go behind to negotiate with the opposition; apart from those I mentioned, a lot of them are not with him, and their body language does not indicate seriousness.</p><p>“If they want to support Tinubu, they should, and if they are not interested, they should come out like other governors and say no, they are not working with him, just like Wike who says he’s a PDP member but won’t work with Atiku.”</p><h2>Muslim-Muslim Ticket</h2><p>Speaking further, he said Tinubu’s decision to pick Senator Kashim Shettima as running mate was a masterstroke, as the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Muslim-Muslim</a></strong> ticket would get sympathy votes from the North.</p><p>“Tinubu will pull sympathy votes from the North; the vote in the Northern part of the country will be split, so he will take as much as possible.</p><p>“Most of the votes in the North will not come in blocs as it has always been; the 2023 election is coming with a lot of dynamics that you can predict, and it won’t be business as usual.</p><p>“Anybody who tells you that the North will give you full vote either on the religious or ethnic ground is lying; it won’t work,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49xZpqqlayubsXOrquhq12nsrexwKVkqKacrnq1tNGenGamn6fBqbHRp2Sgp6aav6%2B70axkm5mToLavs4ytoKetkqp6tK3YZquhnV2nsrTAjJqpnmWUmrCmtdWipaBlmJ66br%2FEnmSnmZ2awHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
