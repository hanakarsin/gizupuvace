And since many of our favorite celebs are privileged to live that lifestyle, some everyday people vie to make that their reality.</p><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> is one of many social media platforms that showcase just how much some folks are obsessed with designer clothing and footwear. Some influencers make it a point to share designer hauls or simply document their experiences while shopping in luxury settings.</p><p>One TikTok user shared her experience while working for <a href=#>Gucci</a> and teased about the possibility of working for a short period and quitting to keep the free items. Unfortunately, the Italian fashion house wasn't pleased and they kicked the employee to the curb.</p><p>Yes, you read that correctly!</p><p>Here’s the tea.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@moradi.mp4</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman was fired after bragging about getting free Gucci items while working for the company.</h2><p>Social media is easily available for use, but that doesn’t mean documenting every facet of your life is smart.</p><p>TikTok user Summer (or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@moradi.mp4</a>) learned this lesson the hard way. On April 4, 2023, Summer shared a TikTok video of herself and items she received from Gucci as an employee.</p><p>“Should I just keep the bag or ghost,” Summer captioned the video.</p><p>As the video starts, the text reads, “Everything Gucci gave me for free on my first-day unboxing,” as Summer holds two large Gucci bags.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Summer then showed off various items including blouses, trousers, blazers, a bag, a belt, and four pairs of socks. The video continues with Summer unveiling different shoe styles and clothing items. She even tried on a few items.</p><p>Unfortunately, Summer’s experience with Gucci was seemingly cut short a week later. On April 15, 2023, Summer posted a video in response to someone else's comment that reads, “Get hired at Gucci, get freebies, work one day, quit, and keep the freebies.”</p><p>“So fun fact, they don’t let you keep the freebies,” Summer said in the video. “How do I know? Because they made me give it back after firing me for that TikTok.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok users weren't surprised to learn that Summer was fired by Gucci over her video.</h2><p>After Summer revealed her new circumstances online, TikTok users immediately flocked to her comment section to share their sentiments.</p><p>The general consensus on TikTok is that Summer being fired doesn't come as a surprise. In the past, multiple people have voiced <a href=#>being fired from their job</a> after sharing videos about their employers on social media.</p><p>“I knew they were going to fire you. Everyone who posts about their job gets fired,” one person commented.</p><p>“What did you think was going to happen?” another user asked Summer.</p><p>Interestingly, some folks shared that Summer did Gucci a favor by giving the brand free promo online.</p><p>“They should have given you a promotion in marketing instead of firing you. You made it look cool to work there. It’s their loss,” one person commented.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>No matter where you stand in regard to Summer being fired from Gucci, it does serve as a lesson to us all. Not everything should be shared on social media. Bragging about keeping items from your employers won’t likely bode well.</p><p>Since social media is easily accessible, it’s best to think that everything you post is basically under a microscope. So, be smart with what you post online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mnaKqlZl6orLTnqlmmqKWtKi1zaBkmpqfqsFustGenGafpZiwqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
