I am also praying that this time it would be something worth it. Because as a Christian I don’t believe in dating. I don’t approve of it anymore. I don’t approve of fornication or sexual relationship outside marriage. My next relationship has to be a courtship. I am looking forward to having that beautiful experience with someone who is in the same spiritual level as me, meet up with my expectations and also be the will of God for me.”</p><p>” However, I still want to take some time to reflect on my personal life, goals and objectives. Sometimes it is good to be alone. Do some amendment on yourself before moving to the next partner. I am strong willed woman. When I tell myself I want to this I always go for it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49uZrCgqWK2brDOp6tmmpWhtqbCxGagp2WUlsGqusZmmJysoprAtHnCoaCopZFitqexzJ6jrpyZoLJuu8%2BepaxlpaV8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
