While she may not be on TikTok anymore (we were not able to find her TikTok), the former TikToker is still on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> and posted on her stories writing, "I AM NOT DEAD" (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">indy100</a>).</p><p>The Instagram story continued stating, "I'm trying to heal and people making this up makes me feel sick that people are fantasizing over this like it's a trend."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The rumors started after Elphaba posted pictures of herself at the hospital. There was some skepticism to this story. People thought that the pictures might have been fake because Elphaba has faced some controversies in the past, specifically ones to do with lying. One of the more well-known cases was when she said she had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tourette's syndrome</a>.</p><p>Another big controversy involving Elphaba was when Jeffree Star accused her of "<a href=#>swatting</a>" them. "Swatting" is a prank that you pull on someone when you call the police and pretend something really bad is happening in the hopes that their house will be surrounded by armed officers.</p><p>While Elphaba has denied having anything to do with the "swatting," it's just another reason why people didn't trust that she was in the hospital.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Elphaba actually followed up her original Instagram story with a video taken from the hospital. The video has the words, "Please stop saying I'm faking being in hospital and treating this as a joke. Let me have a break without lying about me this is all I'm showing you. You can say I'm doing this for attention all you want. I'm trying to prove that I'm not well but people won't even listen to that and posting that I died I feel exhausted."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Elphaba opens the video by stating, "I do want to clear some stuff up, but I am actually in the hospital and I can't believe people are actually saying I'm dead and posting on social media that I faked coming to the hospital."</p><p>Elphaba took to Instagram again on Nov. 13, 2023, to say that she's doing better and that she's with her family once again confirming that she's alive and healing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecSlp6GZkpZ6pbXEZquio6SkuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
