Source: TikTokCleanliness at a restaurant should always be employees' number one priority. Whether it's a fast food spot like Burger King or a 5-star restaurant, guests should never have a problem when it comes to their environment being sanitary enough to enjoy their meal.
This also applies to the back of the house."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Whether it's a fast food spot like <a href=#>Burger King</a> or a 5-star restaurant, guests should never have a problem when it comes to their environment being sanitary enough to enjoy their meal.</p><p>This also applies to the back of the house. Guests can't see the pantries their food is stored in, but they should be able to assume that the storage area is clean too. Well, after watching this video, it might be better just to eat at home from now on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A video of a former employee exposing an unsanitary restaurant walk-in fridge is going viral.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p style=text-align:justify>In August 2023, <a href=#>TikTok</a> user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@uglytimbit</a> uploaded a video of her former job's food storage issues. And the clip was pure horror. Not only were dry foods mixed in with meat products, but nothing was sealed appropriately.</p><p>Near the end of the video, she zoomed in on a filthy rack that was holding a lot of meat on it. Directly below it was a tub of chicken with no covering on it. Meaning, that whatever rust and grime that fell off of the rack above it, which didn't seem as though it had been cleaned in years, was going right on the chicken.</p><p>The former employee even exposed the fact that the restaurant's ginger dressing was sitting in a gigantic trash can. Needless to say, if their customers knew that all of this was back there, they would run for the hills.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Viewers had a lot to say about this video.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@uglytimbit href=#>@uglytimbit</a><p>the walk-in at a job i recently quit. no dates, no coverings, just a lawless wasteland of cross contamination. <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=xyzbca href=#>#xyzbca</a> <a title=serverlife href=#>#serverlife</a> <a title=restaurant href=#>#restaurant</a> <a title=gross href=#>#gross</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - uglytimbit" href=#>♬ original sound - uglytimbit</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>The TikTok has gone viral with nearly 1 million views on the platform. It has also caused over a thousand people to share their reactions to the fridge in the comments section of the clip.</p><p>Most viewers agreed that the disgusting pantry resembled the type of restaurant inspections that are shown on Gordon Ramsay's hit food show <a href=#>Kitchen Nightmares</a>. It might even be worse.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>And even though @uglytimbit hasn't disclosed the name of the restaurant, some people have shared an educated guess of the food genre that the place could be known for serving, with one hibachi server speculating the scene looked familiar.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sadly, this isn't the first time restaurant cleanliness has been exposed.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@hazel_gm href=#>@hazel_gm</a><p><a title=restaurant href=#>#restaurant</a> <a title=server href=#>#server</a> <a title=serverlife href=#>#serverlife</a> <a title=truths href=#>#truths</a> <a title=theuglytruth href=#>#theuglytruth</a> <a title=restaurantsecrets href=#>#restaurantsecrets</a> <a title=cook href=#>#cook</a> <a title=waitstaff href=#>#waitstaff</a> <a title=restaurantreview href=#>#restaurantreview</a> <a title=heresmystory href=#>#heresmystory</a> <a title=shockingtruth href=#>#shockingtruth</a> <a title=nightshift href=#>#nightshift</a> <a title=dayshift href=#>#dayshift</a> <a title=industrysecrets href=#>#industrysecrets</a> <a title=waitressing href=#>#waitressing</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Hazel" href=#>♬ original sound - Hazel</a></figure><p>This repulsive video has warned viewers to recognize that not all storage facilities that your food is coming out of in restaurants are sanitary. But, that's not all you need to beware of.</p><p>In July 2023, a TikToker by the name of @hazel_gm exposed the harsh reality of food service from her perspective of being a server in <a href=#>a video titled Ugly Truth</a>.</p><p>Hazel revealed that most of the time, servers do not wash their hands throughout the day, which means that their dirty hands have been consistently touching customers' food all day long.</p><p>Not only that, but she recalled a personal experience when she saw another employee wash a filthy table and then make a salad without washing their hands between activities.</p><p>Nonetheless, @uglytimbit should definitely report the restaurant she used to work at to the health department for its disgusting walk-in fridge. Enough is enough!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqru0rc2iq5qqqWK%2Fpr%2FTmqyrmZ6perity6RkoqZdm7%2BqsMae</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
