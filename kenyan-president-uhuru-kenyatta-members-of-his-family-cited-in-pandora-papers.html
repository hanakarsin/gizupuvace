One of them, an apartment near Westminster in London, valued at an estimated £1million, was until this summer rented to a UK Member of Parliament. As for the Kenyan president’s younger brother, Muhoho Kenyatta, he is said to own an offshore company with a portfolio of cash, stocks and bonds worth $31.6 million in 2016.</p><p>Other documents from the leaked show a foundation created in Panama in 2003 for the president’s mother, now 88, “Mama” Ngina Kenyatta. Upon his death, all assets held in the foundation were to pass to his son, Uhuru. In 2018, the latter, questioned by the BBC on the wealth of his family, declared bluntly: “I have always said that what we have is open to the public. As a civil servant, I am supposed to make my fortune known and we declare it every year”.</p><p>Uhuru Kenyatta and his family did not respond to the ICIJ’s requests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49tZqSdnq6ur3nPq5ysoZSau7V51KGsq61doLKvxcCtq5plnZq6o7HRrGSonl2dtrR5xZqkoqSpYrCqwMSdZKKmXaWur7DOq5hmqJGlsrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
