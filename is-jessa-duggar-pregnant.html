Unfortunately, the appointment revealed Jessa had suffered a miscarriage.</p><p>"As soon as [the ultrasound tech] started taking a look at the baby, I could tell there was some concern in her voice," Jessa said. "She said, 'Well, the sac looks good — baby does not.' Honestly, nothing could have prepared me for the weight of those words in that moment."</p><p>Ultimately, Jessa underwent a procedure called a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">D&C</a>, which removed the unviable pregnancy.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jessa had had a previous miscarriage before, as well.</h2><p>Previously, Jessa suffered a miscarriage in between welcoming her third child, Ivy, and becoming pregnant with her fourth child, Fern.</p><p>On Feb.18, 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessa took to Instagram</a> in February 2021 to share that she and Ben were expecting their fourth child.
