It left many viewers wondering — where is the real-life location of the scene, and is it as eery as it's shown in the movie?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lake Piru is the location where the lake scene in 'The Babysitter: Killer Queen' was filmed.</h2><p>The ghastly events depicted by The Babysitter: Killer Queen build toward one blasphemous scene in which long-vanished cult-leader Bee takes matters into her own hands and assumes control over the activities conducted by her devilish crew.&nbsp;Materializing seemingly out of nowhere, the character makes an unexpected return by nonchalantly emerging from a lake. The scene, as a recent article by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Press Pass LA</a> prompts, was shot near Lake Piru, a reservoir in California.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Lake Piru might ring a bell to Los Angeles-based nature enthusiasts and beyond. The beautiful location is known for its unpredictable weather conditions and potentially life-threatening whirlpools. As a previous <a href=#>Distractify</a> article reveals, about seven people drowned in the lake between 1994 and 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the latest victims is Glee star Naya Rivera, whose body was discovered on Monday, July 13, 2020. The location choice was not a reference to the tragedy, as The Babysitter: Killer Queen was reportedly shot between Oct. 14, 2019 and Nov. 24, 2019. However, Lake Piru does have a slight reputation for its celebrity accidents, as it was also the place where Harrison Ford crashed a helicopter into the ground in October 1999.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the majority of the scenes featured in the movie, the chilling lake scene was shot far away from the carefully monitored world of film studios. The rest of the movie was likely filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, Calif., <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemablend</a> reveals.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SEEING STARS</a>, The Babysitter was made in Los Angeles as well, with filming locations ranging from the El Segundo High School in El Segundo, Calif., the Irwindale Speedway in Irwindale, Calif., and Blondie Street, Burbank, Calif.</p><p>The latter is a part of the Warner Ranch, a location that was home to the iconic fountain scene in the opening credit of Friends, SEEING STARS reveals. Other notable productions created here include the 1989 National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Film Oblivion, the El Segundo High School has served as the backdrop of some of the most popular comedies out there, including the 2007 Superbad or the 2008 Role Models.&nbsp;Likewise, Irwindale Speedway was the shooting location of movies like the 2005 family-comedy starring Lindsay Lohan, titled Herbie: Fully Loaded, alongside TV dramas like Fear Factor or Malcolm in the Middle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The cast of 'The Babysitter: Killer Queen' includes Bella Thorne, Leslie Bibb, and the like.</h2><p>The Babysitter: Killer Queen sees the grand return of some of the oddest characters featuring in the first movie.&nbsp;</p><p>The illustrious members of the "psycho breakfast club," including John (Andrew Bachelor), Max (Robbie Amell), Sonya (Hana Mae Lee), and Allison (Bella Thorne) all make a comeback to finish what they started and finally complete the ritual.&nbsp;</p><p>Intriguingly enough, however, cult-leader and babysitter, Bee, (Samara Weaving) plays a significantly smaller role in the sequel. She features in several flashbacks illustrating how she recruited the members of the cult — before reappearing in the lake scene.&nbsp;</p><p>So, do the members of the "psycho breakfast club" succeed in their mighty quest? There's only one way to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>The Babysitter: Killer Queen is available on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecGambKrmanBpr6MpKClpJWnerLBxJ6lZqSRoLJuuM6cmK2hn6M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
