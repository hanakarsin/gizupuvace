Most of the time you feel like your friend can't be themselves around that person. Or the worst sign: they like strawberry milk over chocolate.</p><p>But Marwan Alteir, who also goes by Rocky, has taken it upon himself to learn from his past relationship mistakes so that he doesn't repeat the errors of the past.

He provides countermeasures to help ensure that the craziness doesn't affect you too adversely with some solid tips and strategies for keeping said craziness in check. Like purchasing pho or boba tea for the nail-wearer in question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzfeed</a>, Marwan said that he first started compiling the guide back in the summer of 2018 and took the time to gather some real data, as he wanted to go about crafting the guide in as scientific a manner as possible.</p><p>When asked what his reasoning was behind making the booklet in the first place, it was all about the preservation of his bros physical and mental health:</p><p>"I created this research to protect my bros around the world. They need to know what they’re getting into. I’m pretty confident on my research, but like I said, results will vary. I actually started the guide back in 2018 around summertime. I knew exactly what I wanted to do and how I wanted to present it, but getting the data was the hardest part."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And although this is obviously meant to be taken as a joke first and foremost, Marwan did reveal that there was an actual level of research and scientific methods and surveying that went into the study:</p><p>"Research was conducted with 20 male friends and 10 male strangers. I showed each of them diagrams and images. If more than one guy said the same thing about a particular nail, it would go on the book," he said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And while there are tons of people cracking up and nodding their heads in agreement to the gospel that Marwan is preaching, there are some who are angry that he spilled the beans about the hidden meanings behind nail shapes and styles:</p><p>"I had a girl DM me that she hates me because I cracked the code and let out the secrets. She said she was going find where I live and burn the book," he told BF.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you want to check out the full guide, you can see him hilariously break down all the styles in these two videos he uploaded to his Twitter account:</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tired of chasing the wrong girl?
