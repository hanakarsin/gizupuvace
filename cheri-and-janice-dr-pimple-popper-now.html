As to her most memorable guests to date? It has to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheri and Janice</a>, the sisters with identical lipomas. We investigate: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where are they now</a>?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, where are Cheri and Janice from 'Dr. Pimple Popper' now?</h2><p>The two sisters turned to Dr. Pimple Popper with a very specific request, asking her to take care of their similarly-shaped lipomas. While Janice's benign tumor warranted a relatively simple and straightforward procedure — only requiring a few, minor incisions — the lump on Cheri's right shoulder re-defined viewers' expectations.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"We removed Janice's lipoma, it was pretty much without drama," Dr. Pimple Popper explained in the episode titled "Sisters Lumpity Lump Lump."&nbsp;</p><p>As the episode revealed, Janice had a relatively large, elliptical-shaped tumor in the middle of her left-hand upper-arm. Once extracted, the contents of the lump turned out to be little else but an elliptical-shaped, bizarrely jelly-like piece of fat tissue laced with rosy-pink bits.&nbsp;</p><p>Cheri was much less fortunate. After a brief examination, Dr. Pimple Popper confirmed that her problem is a great deal more difficult than that of her sister's, proving that they don't share the same skin condition.&nbsp;</p><p>"Is it mushy? Is it like Brie? Is it like cream of mushroom soup? I can't wait to find out," Sandra said.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's like opening a present at Christmas. [...] It's right there too. It's a cyst," she concluded.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Cheri had a 15-year-old cyst on her right upper-arm. Once opened, an oatmeal-like, off-white material started oozing out of the monstrous bulge, a ghastly substance Dr. Pimple Popper identified as the residue of rotten skin.&nbsp;</p><p>"What's the smelly, smelly, smelly?" Cheri asked.</p><p>"That's the cyst. That's like old skin cells that are stuck under you for years, you know, for fifteen years. I feel like it would smell like toe gem, or something, something like your skin has been sitting there for a while. That's essentially what the smell is," Dr. Pimple Popper explained.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm pretty sure that Janice started off hating this stuff, she could not bear to watch it. But then I feel her over my shoulder peering in and watching every step of my removing the rest of Cheri's cyst. So I think I've created a pop-aholic. Janice, welcome to the dark side," the doctor explained in a crucial scene of the episode.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Unfortunately, the sisters' current whereabouts are unknown.</h2><p>The sisters' name doesn't appear on the episode credit list, and neither did they agree to provide their full names.&nbsp;</p><p>They single-handedly redefined what sisterly love is, showing the world that a matching lipoma can be treated as another manifestation of a lifelong bond. Unfortunately, they haven't made a public appearance since the launch of the much-hyped Dr. Pimple Popper episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of Dr. Pimple Popper every Wednesday at 10 p.m. on TLC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWmvshmmKecXZ%2Bur7XCnmSdql2ltq68y55kqaegpbKzec2org%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
