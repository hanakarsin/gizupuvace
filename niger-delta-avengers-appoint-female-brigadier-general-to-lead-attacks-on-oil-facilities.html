She is an experienced field agent who before now was the head of the counter intelligence unit of the NDA, using her connections with top government and security officials to deliver on her assignment.</p><p>“She was part of our elite Strike Teams that attacked and took down the Chevron Valve platform on the 4th of May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line on the 3rd of June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline on the 11th of July, 2016.”</p><p>“Brig. Gen. Tu-ere is the first female to ever attain this level and it is solely out of merit, and is placed in charge by the High Command of the NDA to execute operation humble to the later.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Nollywood actor, Emma Ehumadu aka Emma Lambista has declared that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>those outside Nigeria</a></strong> and clamouring for secession should have a rethink.</p><p>This is as he declared that such persons can’t be hiding in the comfort of other countries and expect others in Nigeria to be the ones leading the agitation for secession.</p><p>Ehumadu who took to his social media account, called out people like the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and others agitating for a breakaway.</p><p>In his warning, the actor said such people should be careful of what they’re asking for and avoid setting the country on the path of war because of their own selfish interests.</p><p>He however agreed that the issue of marginalization exists, calling for focus to be shifted to solving that challenge rather than call for secession.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FvZqehl5q%2FbrDEpauaZZGrsq%2BzxKuqZpmgpbyqutNmnZ6lkaGybq7Rop6anJmav26zxKecq5mcYsGwecuemJ1lkanBoq%2FKrGSopl2ktq15xZqaoqSZqbamv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
