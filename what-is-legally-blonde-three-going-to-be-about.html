Source: GettyAlmost two full decades have passed since the slightly underwhelming sequel to Legally Blonde (which, in case you didn't remember, was titled Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde) premiered back in 2003. However, it seems as though the widely beloved rom com is getting a third installment, so we can all live out our beloved pre-teen years once again."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Since speculations are currently running rampant, we've done a little digging to find out more about the highly anticipated third Legally Blonde film.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It‚Äôs true... #LegallyBlonde3</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Reese Witherspoon</a> (@reesewitherspoon) on Jun 7, 2018 at 5:02am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'Legally Blonde 3' going to be about?</h2><p>As of publication, not much is known regarding the plot of Legally Blonde 3, however, we do have a little information that could give us insight on what to expect. According to Deadline, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reese Witherspoon (who played Elle Woods in the first two films) is going to reprise her role</a> of the ambitious attorney almost 20 years after her case regarding the ban of animal testing. Rumor has it she may run for office, or something of the like.</p><p>It's also been confirmed that the third movie isn't going to be a "makeover" or a remake of any kind. The screenplay is apparently going to be totally fresh with a brand-new plot, and most likely some new characters. We're really hoping for a return from Emmett, Paulette, and Elle's beloved pup Bruiser, but the latter is somewhat unlikely, unless they've found a way to keep dogs alive for over 20 years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who else will be working on the movie?</h2><p>Although the original screenwriters are apparently no longer set to write the screenplay for Legally Blonde 3, we're looking forward to having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mindy Project's Mindy Kaling, who will be co-writing alongside Dan Gnoor</a>, according to PopSugar. This is apparently their second project together, as they're also reportedly working on a wedding comedy with Priyanka Chopra.</p><p>The third film in the franchise will also apparently be produced through Reese's production studio, Hello Sunshine, which will be led by the franchise's original producer, Marc Platt. Needless to say, we know it's going to be good.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When Reese isn't working on 'Legally Blonde 3,' she's exploring the world of TikTok.</h2><p>We all know that Reese is a social media boss, and earlier this year, her teenage son, <a href=#>Deacon, helped her join the short-form video platform, known as TikTok</a>. The two did a video together in which he showed her a classic TikTok dance, which she obviously slayed, and since, she's made a handful of other quality vids.</p><p>She also took to the app to show off her new Ivy Park wardrobe from her BFF, Beyonc√©. Needless to say, she's thriving online and in the world of Hollywood.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@officialreesetiktok href=#>@officialreesetiktok</a><p>Deacon teaches me how to <a title=dap href=#>##dap</a> ü§ù <a title=dapchallenge href=#>##dapchallenge</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - officialreesetiktok" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - officialreesetiktok</a></figure><p>It goes without saying we're hyped for Legally Blonde 3, so we'll definitely keep you posted on more updates.
