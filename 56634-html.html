Joshua has recently conducted a Question-and-Answer session with his followers via Facebook. He answered a number of questions sent in by his almost 900,000 army of fans from all over Africa and the rest of the world.</strong></p><p>One of the fans asked if a person&nbsp;person who has not been delivered from evil spirit can continue to act/confess to Jesus even though the urge to sin torments them. Joshua replied:&nbsp;"Those who have not been delivered will call the name Jesus but not from the heart.&nbsp;When you call the name Jesus and not such in heart, you only hear yourself and people around you hear you but Jesus Christ will not hear you. This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva one day."</p><p>The next question came in from Indonesia, and a female follower asked Joshua how&nbsp;he maintains his anointing "in the midst of temptation and crisis". Joshua answered thus:&nbsp;"If you are with God in truth and faith, whatever comes as a blessing or trial will be what God allows. I have a covenant with God. I cannot ask for anything outside what is written in the covenant. What I will achieve in this world is in a book I am carrying everyday; I just have to open the pages. Outside the book is not mine."</p><p>A man from Botswana asked&nbsp;about the issue of deliverance: "Does it mean when the pastor calls the congregation for an altar call that the pastor is wasting their time and those that went for an altar call have not been saved?" Joshua replied:&nbsp;"Confession is a part of salvation, just as believing is a part. (...) We need faith to release the belief in our heart. Today, we pray but lack the necessary faith to release the belief in our heart."</p><p>A Zimbabwean fan spoke on behalf of the youths. "I would very much appreciate if you would share with us some of the habits that preserved you during your youth days."&nbsp;"You just have to follow the principle of 'time for everything' – there is a time to be born and a time to grow," Joshua said in his reply. "The young ones are under the 'time to grow.' A time for anything to grow is a time to sacrifice. Your time, your strength, everything you have – sacrifice for God, your Creator.&nbsp;Here, God's responsibility and man's responsibility should be obeyed and followed strictly. Work as if everything depends on you."</p><p>A man from Ethiopia asked, "If you have to be delivered before you become born again, how can people become Christians without access to people like T.B. Joshua?" The pastor had this to say:&nbsp;"One can be delivered without having physical contact with any minister of God, depending on how much the Word of God dominates your heart. You can be delivered in the dream, vision by seeing any minister of God come and pray for you, to deliver you from cancer, affliction or any form of infirmity. You can be delivered for the salvation of your soul. It depends on how much the Word dominates your heart before you receive such unique, awesome grace."</p><p>Finally, a&nbsp;Zambian man wrote, "How can one know that this is the man/ woman God has destined for youto marry?"&nbsp;Here is T.B. Joshua's answer: "Love is a thing of the heart and God is love. Your love towards a person should be not because of outward attraction but deeds. This can only happen when you are delivered and the person in question is delivered. &nbsp;When you are delivered and the person in question is not delivered and you have a sort of love towards him or her, your spirit will not agree to such love until that person is delivered because you will not want to be contaminated.&nbsp;</p><p>"But if both of you are not delivered, there is no way you can make a right choice – darkness to darkness. There is no one to advise towards deliverance because both of you are in darkness. A person in the dark cannot see until he gets into light – the Spirit of God is light. That is what I mean by 'faith is of man's spirit'. It is when one is delivered that one can have discernment to know if the person you have a sort of love for is not yet delivered and you can then take them for deliverance."</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgneCkm1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
