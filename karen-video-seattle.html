But Karlos wasn't about to let her get away with her racist outburst. He followed her to an apartment building, confronted her when she got out of her car, and she immediately lost it, screaming and crying.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This Karen cut me off, break checked some almost causing a accident flipped me off and called me out of my name. She didn’t know I had time today. <a href=#>#karenareyouokay</a> <a href=#>#karen</a> <a href=#>#blacktwitter</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sQsKpLcE6D</a></p>— Karlos Dillard (@wypipo_h8) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><p>"I have a Black husband!" she yells. "You don't understand what happened!" She screams with her hands over her face, presumably to protect her identity. Karlos asks her if she can explain to him, calmly, what did happen. "No because you're attacking me right now!" she whines.</p><p>When Karlos films her license plate number, she screams and runs over to cover it. It seems clear that she knows exactly what she did and was trying to avoid having her identity discovered and her racist behavior exposed.</p><p>Eventually, a crowd forms, including some people who witnessed the road rage incident. In several more videos posted to Karlos' Instagram story, the woman can be seen lying on the ground behind her car, crying, while people gather.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the video went viral, amassing more than four million views, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I HAVE A BLACK HUSBAND</a>" has trended on Twitter, and Karlos has started selling t-shirts with quotes from the videos.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>When someone on<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Instagram</a> questioned Karlos about why he started to try to profit off of the instance immediately, he responded, "White people have profited off Black oppression and hurt of generations, so shall we. I'm also a comedian with a t-shirt company. The only weird thing about this is how she reacted."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to NewsOne</a>, as neighbors gathered, Karlos and the woman began talking to each other. "I'm a Black gay man and I live my life going through this every day," he says to her. "Just spread love and happiness."</p><p>She tells him she wants to "explain her perception" of the situation, but Karlos tells her he doesn't care. She still seems to play the victim and doesn't take responsibility for her actions.&nbsp;</p><p>If she never cut him off, if she never drove aggressively, none of this would be happening. But this woman took her anger out on a Black man, and he called her out publicly. The whole video, which is 15 minutes long, can be viewed on Karlos's Instagram account.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I’m literally not leaving my house anymore. This Karen cut me off, break checked me and then followed me for 4 blocks. When I started recording her antics she peeled off and tried to get away with her racism.

She tries to dodge allegations that she flipped him off and repeatedly says that he doesn't know what's "in her heart."</p><p>Eventually, she cried and says, "I'm sorry," and she introduces herself as Leah.
