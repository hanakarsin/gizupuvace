Source: ABCAlissa Turney was 17 years old when she went missing. The last person to see her was her stepdad, Michael Turney, who claimed he took the teen out of school early and the two went to lunch. That day, she vanished. This was in 2001. Fast forward to today, justice for Alissa has finally been served: Turney, her stepfather, has been arrested and faces second-degree murder charges in the death of Alissa."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

According to Crime Online, a note was found, allegedly written by Alissa (it was later suspected she was forced to write it), that told family members that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had moved to California</a>. Turney reported her disappearance to the police, but the trail eventually turned cold. However, in 2008, the Phoenix Police Missing Persons Unity Cold Case detectives started to think something much more sinister happened to Alissa, and that her stepfather had something to do with it. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Thank you to @investigationsforthemissing for always supporting Alissaâ€™s case. ðŸ’œPosted @withregram â€¢ @investigationsforthemissing ðŸ—“On This DateðŸ—“ Alissa Marie Turney disappeared from Phoenix, Arizona on May 17, 2001, the last day of her junior year at Paradise Valley High School.

It was also found that Turney had been previously accused of sexual abuse. That year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Turney was arrested</a> â€” but not for the disappearance of Alissa. In December 2008, Phoenix Police stated they found "multiple handguns, rifles, and 32 improvised explosive devices," per Fox 10 local news. It was the biggest seizure of IEDs they'd ever come across.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span><p>Alissa and her father</p></figure><p>According to news.com.au, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the police found evidence of a plan</a> to drive a van filled with explosives into a local union hall (apparently he had a dispute with someone there), and then shoot the victims who managed to escape. Turney went to jail in 2010 and was released in 2017. Sarah, Alissa's younger sister, started her podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Voices for Justice</a>, and used it as a platform to discuss Alissa's case. To this day, Sarah hasn't stopped fighting for Alissa.</p><p>Other disturbing facts about Michael Turney have been discovered, per news.com.au. For instance, he had a camera in the living room that would record Alissa making out with her boyfriend. He also asked Alissa to sign a contract saying he never molested her. In an interview on ABC 2020, he was described as being "obsessed" with Alissa, as well as demeaning. A voice recording surfaced that showed he called Alissa a "bitch," but he denied treating her poorly. As you can tell from the video, Turney was extremely defensive when asked any questions about his stepdaughter.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sarah has been extremely involved her sister's case.</h2><p>Along with her podcast, Sarah (who is actually Turney's biological daughter â€” she and Alissa were stepsisters) has been uploading evidence that would point to her father as being the main suspect on TikTok. She's posted recordings of her father calling Alissa "retarded," claiming that she had mental disabilities.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@saraheturney href=#>@saraheturney</a><p>Pt. 2 Iâ€™ve read about this tape in police reports but hearing it hits different. ðŸ’” <a title=justiceforalissa href=#>##justiceforalissa</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a> <a title=voicesforjusticepodcast href=#>##voicesforjusticepodcast</a> <a title=truecrime href=#>##truecrime</a> <a title=foryou href=#>##foryou</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - saraheturney" href=#>â™¬ original sound - saraheturney</a></figure><p>She also posted a video Turney took when he was spying on Alissa while she was at work</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@saraheturney href=#>@saraheturney</a><p>Listen to the Voices for Justice podcast for the full story.
