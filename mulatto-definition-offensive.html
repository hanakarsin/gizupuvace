But some people aren’t fans of the 21-year-old, mostly because the word “mulatto,” by definition, is offensive to many people."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I don’t like saying I’m white or black.”</p><p>She started rapping when she was 10 years old, even as she dealt with bullying from her peers.</p><p>“[There were] definitely a lot of issues at school,” she said. “When you’re light-skinned, they kinda associate you with the stereotypical light-skinned ‘I think I’m all that’ girl. I definitely dealt with a lot of bullying.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The rapper’s parents caught flak for her stage name.</h2><p>As her career started taking off, Mulatto and her parents got flak for her stage name.</p><p>“When I do shows and there’s older people in the crowd that are more aware of the term, they used to come up to my parents, like, ‘How dare you call yourself this?’ But for me, it’s not that deep. It’s me embracing who I am, and it’s hard to express to someone that wouldn’t know the struggles that mixed people do experience."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: VLAD TV/YouTube</span></figure><p>She continued, "So, it’s kind of something that I just brush off my shoulders now. You can’t explain it to people. You wouldn’t understand it because you don’t live it, you know what I’m saying?”</p><p>Mulatto said that she and her parents were “very emotional” about the backlash at first. “But eventually, we took it and ran with it. And it’s like, you’re not going to understand it, period. You’re not going to understand. It’s something that me and my family experienced as a biracial family, so it’s not even worth explaining or breaking down to anybody.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Mulatto is aware of her name’s derogatory history.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CBC News</u></a>, most lexicographers believe the term came from the Spanish and Portuguese words for mule — the offspring of a horse and a donkey. People started using the word to refer to mixed-race children about 400 years ago — and, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>NPR</u></a> reports, mulatto became a racial category on the U.S. Census in 1850 as “sort of a catch-all for anyone perceived as racially ambiguous, including many Native Americans.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by BIG LATTO🎰 (@mulatto)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Today, many people find the word offensive. “I am white and my wife is Ethiopian and Indian. Well-meaning educated people still sometimes refer to our children as ‘mulatto,’” a reader told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The New York Times</u></a> in 2017. “Can’t stand that word. I view it as dated as ‘negro’ or ‘colored.’”</p><p>“It’s not even something that people would want to call themselves. … It definitely is a similar term to the N-word,” Mulatto told VladTV. “It was like a racial slur to mixed people.”</p><p>But the rapper seems intent on reclaiming the word. “You know, for me, it’s deeper than just saying, ‘Oh, I’m mixed. That’s why my name is Mulatto.’ … It’s kind of like a double metaphor. Not literally ‘mulatto,’ meaning I’m mixed; ‘mulatto,’ meaning a term that was once a negative word that I’m using in a positive light now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfosKtrdOtpmaclZu2r7XToqanZZ%2Bbs6a60qKtng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
