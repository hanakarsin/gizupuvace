Sue described Anna as her rock in a 2017 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"She is much less chaotic than me and has done quite a lot to still the gyroscope of my whirring brain," Sue told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans love the couple anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>"Anna Richardson & Sue Perkins = new fave celeb couple," tweeted a person.&nbsp;</p><p>"Anna Richardson & Sue Perkins are a match made in heaven right?!
