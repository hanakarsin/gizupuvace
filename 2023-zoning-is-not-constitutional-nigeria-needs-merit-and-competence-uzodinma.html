He however added that issues of competence and merit should be considered above zoning as the race for the 2023 presidency thickens."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Actually, in the books of our democracy (1999 constitution), tribe or place of origin is not a factor.</p><p>“So, all I say in my good conscience and moral instinct is that Nigerians should vote in a representative manner where everyone will have a feel of what the presidency is in reality, but beyond that and very importantly, is the need for merit and competence. They should be the driving criteria for selecting a president. This country has gone through a lot of trouble and temptations. It is high time we did this rightly in Nigeria.”</p><p>Uzodinma also accused desperate politicians of being the ones behind the various challenges of insecurity in Nigeria due to their selfish ambitions.</p><p>He however distanced himself from participating in that kind of politics, stating that he would rather quit politics than promote violence and spill blood to win elections.</p><p>He also called on Nigerians of all classes to play by the rules and desist from heating up the political atmosphere.</p><p>He said, “I don’t belong to the class of politicians that will encourage violence. I don’t belong to the class of politicians that will spill blood (to win elections). I will rather prefer not to be a politician than to be an instrument of violence. If you recall the history of elections in Nigeria, it has always been greeted with anxiety in the beginning.</p><p>“But as we make progress, the anxiety comes down and the people also come out to follow the electoral timetable as provided by INEC.</p><p>“The only aspect that is different is the contrived insecurity that is now taking lives and all sorts of banditry and kidnapping. Evil is bad and stands condemned. We should shun violence in all its ramifications and embrace the rule of free, fair, and conducive environment for everyone.</p><p>“I invite my colleagues, political leaders, and the entire political elite to tow the path of good conscience and fear of God in all they do and say, because that is only what we need to attract the mercy and forgiveness of God.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49wZmtoYmh6u7vNoqWgZZmoeq%2B702aaqKajqba1wdOipqeZnGK7qrPEq6CaZZ6asqW%2FjKacq6GkYq6vsIycpqaolamyr6%2FEZqyzp5Seu66tjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
