Recall that Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja had sacked Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, for dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC).
In his reaction, Umahi described his removal and that of his deputy from office by Justice Ekwo as “a hatchet” man’s job, adding that the judge was wrong in his ruling."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That your sorry, we the members of the public, we don’t take it.”</p><p>Wike said PDP’s resolve to challenge Umahi and other defectors elected on the party’s platform is a clear example of what is required to strengthen democracy.</p><p>He said, “If our party has done this earlier when people were leaving in the National Assembly, we won’t have had the problem we are having today.</p><p>“That is one of the problems of party leadership. People cannot come out and take the bull by the horns. So, Governor Umahi, be rest assured that PDP will continue this matter down to Supreme Court. We will continue with the matter.</p><p>“You carry the votes of another party and join another party. Can you transfer votes? You work hard for somebody to win election and tomorrow, the person says I have defected.</p><p>“If you have defected, leave the seat if you know it’s easy. And this will checkmate most of these political harlots who will never sit one place.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BrZp6an6PGqnnWoqKeZZujvKS30masppmYnnqnu9FmmpqknJ67qHnJrpugnV2drrWvx56rZqWRo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
