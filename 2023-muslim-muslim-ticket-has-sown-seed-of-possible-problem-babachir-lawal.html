If you go into the government in which ab initio the Christian population fell discriminated against, whatever that government will do, there will be no interest in supporting them.</p><p>“I can tell you that this is not about religion; it’s about inclusiveness; it’s about equity, justice and peaceful coexistence. No Muslim wants to live in an acrimonious relationship with a Christian. The fight we’re fighting is for everybody.</p><p>“Islam preaches justice We live together all these years peacefully; we go to the same school and workplace; We live on the same street; we never had any problem, but this thing has sown the seed of the possible problem.”</p><p>According to Lawal, President Muhammadu Buhari does not appoint based on religion or ethnicity, but relay on recommendations.</p><p>He said, “Basically he relies on the recommendation of others for his appointment and those people must do the balancing. I know one example that I can cite to you that has done very well is the minister of education. They try to balance their appointment. There are many parastatals but they try to balance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BuZmtoYmh6rsHSpaCmZZ2qwK21zGaropubmsFutMCsZKynp6N6tLHEnWSonl2lvLS%2FyJujnmWgp7yjuMSmZJuZkpawqbXRZqOar5GhfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
