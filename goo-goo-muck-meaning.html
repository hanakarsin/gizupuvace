The 1980 hit track is getting a lot of attention once again.</h2><p>The story of "Goo Goo Muck" is not as linear as the release structure of most songs out there. According to Wikipedia, the version made famous by The Cramps is not actually the original song. Indeed, "Goo Goo Muck" was written by Ronnie Cook and the Gaylads all the way back in 1962. However, their original release did not perform well on the charts.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fast-forward to 1980 when The Cramps released "Psychedelic Jungle," an album comprised of half-new material and half-cover songs. Alongside other tracks such as "Green Door" by Jim Lowe, "Jungle Hop" by Kip Tyler and the Flips, and "Rockin' Bones" by Ronnie Dawson, The Cramps re-recorded "Goo Goo Muck" and catapulted the song to stardom. Today, it is enjoying a resurgence in fame thanks to a choice placement on the hit Netflix series Wednesday.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The entirety of "Goo Goo Muck" is a musical oddity, to say the very least. It's quirky meaning and unique pace made it a perfect song to accompany the storyline of Wednesday, but what exactly is a Goo Goo Muck?</p><p>Well, it appears as though the title is a bit of a double entendre, as validated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Dictionary</a>.</p><p>Through lyrics such as "When the sun goes down, and the moon comes up / I turn into a teenage goo goo muck / Yeah, I cruise through the city and I roam the street / Looking for something that is nice to eat," it's clear that a Goo Goo Muck is a nocturnal monster of sorts. The accompanying single art for the track seems to substantiate this notion as it features some cartoonish monstrous characters as well.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, on the other side, it seems as though a Goo Goo Muck is also a metaphor for someone providing oral sex to another, as highlighted by Urban Dictionary.</p><p>The notion of "Goo Goo Muck" having both a scary and a sexual meaning is furthered as the song goes on, as well. It can be seen clearly in lines such as "I'm the night headhunter looking for some head / With a way out body underneath that head / Well I'll get you baby with a little luck' / Cause I'm teenage tiger and a goo goo muck."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>To close out, The Cramps' lead singer, Lux Interior, sings, "Yeah, the city is a jungle and I'm a beast / I'm a teenage tiger looking for a feast / I want the most but i'll take the least / 'Cause I'm a goo goo muck tiger and a teenage beast."</p><p>At face value, "Goo Goo Muck" passes itself off as a song with spooky leanings, but when you examine the purpose of phrases like "looking for some head" and "looking for a feast," it's pretty apparent that there's a sexual side to it all, as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"Goo Goo Muck" has seen a substantial increase in its streaming numbers since 'Wednesday' was released.</h2><p>It seems as though all artists of yesteryear need nowadays is placement on a hit Netflix show to attract a new generation's interest in their music.</p><p>According to information provided to us by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffbet.com</a>, global searches for The Cramps have soared by 464% since Wednesday launched on Netflix.
