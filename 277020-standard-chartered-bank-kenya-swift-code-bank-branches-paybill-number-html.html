SWIFT codes are used at Standard Chartered Kenya as an identifier of the financial institution worldwide. This standard of codes was initially introduced by the SWIFT organization as swift codes but later standardized by ISO to become BIC (Business Identifier Codes). The swift codes are used by the swift network to transmit money transactions and messages between them. For international money transaction, swift codes are fundamental in making transactions secure and fast.</p><p class=align-left>A SWIFT code is also called a SWIFT ID, SWIFT- BIC or a SWIFT address. Standard Chartered Kenya swift code has either eight or eleven characters. In most cases, you will require the eight-character swift code, consisting of three parts. However, in some cases, if your bank processes payments through a specific branch you will need the eleven-digit code which includes the branch identifier as well. The first four characters in the swift code identify the institution. The 5th, 6th and 7th characters identify the country of the particular institution’s branch. The 8th character contains information about the location. Finally, the last three characters are the branch codes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/274be9c6d330b783.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to transfer money from KCB to Equity bank account in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>So, the Standard Chartered Bank Kenya swift code is SCBLKENX or SCBLKENXXXX where SCBL identifies the bank, while KEN is short for Kenya and last three Xs represents the branch code.
