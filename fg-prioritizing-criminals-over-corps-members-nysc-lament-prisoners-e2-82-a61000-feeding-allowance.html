The budgetary approval for feeding per corps member is N650, which is grossly inadequate. By the time you divide it by three meals (per day), that is N216 per meal. So, we are appealing to this committee to please help us out.</p><p>“Even recently, at the Ministry of Interior, the feeding of prisoners was increased to ₦1,000. So, if we can feed criminals with ₦1,000, our graduates are putting their lives in the service of our country. I pray that this committee should please do something about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49wZp%2BfXaW%2FqrvRoquispmjtG6v0aKkoqaRocBuu9WeqWabn6e9tHnMnqSbnaKoeq%2FF0pxkpZmdmru1ec%2BroKynnpq%2FtHmEfmlecGJajnd9j2lnZp6VmrGqusZmmKWkn6yur6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
