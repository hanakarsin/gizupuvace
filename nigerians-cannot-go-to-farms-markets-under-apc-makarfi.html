Makarfi, who governed Kaduna State, said when PDP was in power, only the Northeast experienced insecurity, but an election was still because of the measures taken by the Goodluck Jonathan-led administration.
He lamented that Nigerians are unable to go to farms, markets, or visit their relatives due to insecurity ravaging the country under the APC administration"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In Nigeria, farming has become very difficult.

We didn’t say because of insecurity, we couldn’t hold an election, but now even in Kaduna State, there is a threat that there will be no political activities in some places not to talk of holding an election. This has never happened in the past.</p><p>“If you inherited something in NorthEast, you are to address it, but instead of addressing the situation, it has now deteriorated,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49rZqehl5q%2Fqq3NrGScmZ6jvLV5xqhkraddm66zudJmpJqqm5rBtHnUp5ueql2WvaR5zJqimqqWnnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
