The areas are called down south, and it’s possible that in that region where animals are infected may have made their way into the country.</p><p>“Most especially for animals that were brought in across the borders. So, in this context, this is the first animal we have diagnosed its condition with, so there may be other animals with it.”</p><p>He lamented that Anthrax may have spread across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).</p><p>“It is also possible that the disease is currently across the country, and likely other cases that are yet to be notified.
