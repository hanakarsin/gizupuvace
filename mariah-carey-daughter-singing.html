I’m a singer’s singer myself, so I know it when I hear it. She got it!”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mariah has said that Monroe has a “great ear” and loves being on stage.</h2><p style=text-align:start>“Both [Moroccan and Monroe] are very musical,” Mariah told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2016. “Monroe … she’s got a great ear, so she can repeat what I sing to her, and you know that’s a telltale sign.”</p><p style=text-align:start>A year later, the singer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a> that Roc and Roe, whom she welcomed with ex-husband <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a>, are natural performers. “They love being on stage, my twins, Roc and Roe. … They’re so brave.
