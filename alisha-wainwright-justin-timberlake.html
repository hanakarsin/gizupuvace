Source: InstagramIt wasn’t that long ago that Justin Timberlake made headlines while filming in New Orleans for his Apple+ movie, Palmer. He seemed highly intoxicated while out partying on a balcony and cozying up to his co-star in the film, Alisha Wainwright. 
Alisha’s reputation seemed to be dead and buried before the world even got a chance to really get to know her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Until then, it seemed like Justin and Jessica had a special, loving relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>One photo showed Alisha’s hand on the inside of Justin’s leg as the pair sat together.

I had to shift my focus to something a little broader, and I wasn’t as interested in it," she continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Alisha then turned to another passion: acting. In 2012, Alisha was making regular appearances in a web comedy sketch on the YouTube channel Smosh.
