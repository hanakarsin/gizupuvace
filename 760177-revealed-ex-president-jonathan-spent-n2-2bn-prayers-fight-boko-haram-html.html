Some monies were later paid into our companies, which we paid to some of the mallams.</i></p><p><i>"I then arranged to recover my personal expense which I put into our own businesses.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Metuh loses suit against EFCC on fundamental human rights</p><p><i>"We have been spending a lot from our businesses and personal accounts.

One in Maitama, one in Gudu and one in Guzape. The Maitama was a little over N200million; Guzape (N80m), Gudu(N18m)."</i></p><p>He added that he kept no records of the money he handed over to the various people they used, but assured the EFCC that he would refund the said cash if he is able to dispose off his landed properties.</p><p>"I am making efforts to dispose of my properties in Abuja which would be over the total amount of N2.2billion. If the sales go through and the amount from the sales is made in full, I will make full payment." he was quoted to have said.</p><p>The 19 charges against the five suspects read that, Baba-Kusa, Acacia Holdings Limited and Reliance Referral Hospital Limited are alleged to have <i>"between October 2014 and April 2015 in Abuja agreed to do an illegal act to wit: dishonestly receiving property to wit: an aggregate sum of N2,200,000,000 being part of the funds in the accounts of the Office of National Security Adviser and that the same act was fine in pursuance of the agreement among you and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 97 of the Penal Code Act, Cap 532, Vol.4, LFN 2004."</i></p><p>Just yesterday, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, the Senate Majority Leader, stated that the former president should face trial if he instigated the sharing of $2.1billion given to Dasuki for the procurement of arms.</p><p>The Nation reports that Ndume expressed his opinion while speaking with journalists on Thursday, March 10, in Abuja.</p><p>The senator stressed that anybody who is involved in that blood money should be held responsible for the crime, while also lamenting that over 10,000 innocent people were slaughtered like chickens because the Nigerian army was not equipped and not well kitted.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHd8kHBuZqqVq7KiuMSdZJ6wXaW%2Fpr%2FInZynrF2fvK%2Bt06GYp2WjpbKvwIynaWZqkqN6sb7Aspyrq12btqi002aZqKOfYrWivsCmZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
