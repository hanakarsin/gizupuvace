Lukman said the party chairman refused to abide by the decision to the choices of Godswill Akpabio and Tajudeen Abbas as the Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives respectively.
The APC chieftain  added that Adamu never campaigned for the party’s adopted candidates for the Senate Presidency and Speakership positions and kept distancing himself from the position of the party."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And as a result if not for the intervention of the president we would have walked into a disaster. I appealed to our leaders to see the country beyond our personal desires.</p><p>“As a party, we ran our campaigns based on the Muslim-Muslim ticket and I would be the first to rationalize that because the choices were very hard choices for the party and for our presidential candidate.</p><p>“It was purely an electoral strategy. If we did that and want to support Asiwaju to run a government that all Nigerians would have a sense of belonging, what were we supposed to do? It was to take steps and amend it by ensuring that the diversity of the country was recognized in the emergence of the leadership of the National Assembly and other arms of government.</p><p>“What did we see? Our National Chairman, even after the party took a decision, was now mobilizing resentment against the decision of our party. He never campaigned for the party’s adopted candidates.</p><p>“He was busy saying the party advised that more consultations should be made. Look at the disaster when the Governors of the party met with him. Even yesterday he confirmed on Arise that the leadership of the party met with him.</p><p>“Now assuming even if it is true they did not consult you, as a leader what stopped him from calling Senator Akpabio and Hon Abass to raise some of these issues and even query them if he was not satisfied with their explanations he could go and meet Asiwaju.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BrZpqckaLCbr7En6ysnZRiwbB5zpucsmWRpbC0ecKhpqKblWK8p3nNmqqsZZyarqWx0ayfoqhdocKsucCnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
