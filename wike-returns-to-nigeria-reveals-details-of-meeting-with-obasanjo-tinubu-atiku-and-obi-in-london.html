We met with the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC and we met with our leader, former president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo.</p><p>“We met the presidential candidate of Labour Party. We also met with our presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. For whatever it’s worth, consultation is ongoing.</p><p>“Whatever we are talking about, is for the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians. It is not parochial and tied to one person or group of persons. We believe that with what is going on, it will be for the interest of Nigerians at the end of the day.”</p><h2>Political Office Is Not Family Inheritance</h2><p>Speaking further, Governor Wike threw shades at politicians who are keen to perpetuate themselves in power as well as others who are replacing themselves with children and other close relatives.</p><p>He described such happenings within Nigeria’s political landscape as unfortunate.</p><p>Wike stated that consultations are still ongoing for 2023 and no final decision has been reached.</p><p>He said: “Consultation is still ongoing. Never mind some people who do not believe in the existence of this country.</p><p>“Leadership is not about you and your family. Leadership is about everybody. It’s unfortunate that we are in a country now where a man finishes eight years as a governor and brings his own son as a governor too and as member of National Assembly.</p><p>“It’s only in this part of the world that you can see that, when we are talking about poverty everywhere. These are people who do not mean well for this Nigeria.”</p><p>Wike said Nigeria needs to do away with sentiments such as religion and ethnicity in choosing leaders, arguing that competence should be the yardstick.</p><p>He said: “The only identity they have in this country is religion and ethnicity, nothing more. It’s either, I’m a Christian or I’m a Moslem, I’m a Fulani or I’m an Igbo. Nigeria cannot move forward except they think it will be them. That’s where we are.</p><p>“We are in a country where someone with primary school certificate can be appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. That tells you how bad this country has become.</p><p>“But with our consultation, all these will be a thing of the past. No amount of intimidation or blackmail will deter us. We are determined to right the wrong.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FvZrChm5p6s7HTrqmnq12pvG66yKCcq6GRYr%2BmwsSao6xllJrBorXLrGSonl2isqbAyKeeZq%2BZqbVuu8GaqpqmmqR6tbXNrpmuZZGptqzBjJqlnWWfl7Zutc1mo6imlKS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
