Here's what we know about Lewis's incredibly rosy financial outlook and what prompted his switch to Ferrari in 2025.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Lewis Hamilton's net worth?</h2><p>Lewis's two-year contract with Mercedes was for 100 million Euros, so it should go without saying that the seven-time champion is incredibly wealthy. Just how wealthy, you might ask? Well, he has an estimated net worth of roughly $285 million thanks to his massive contracts for actual racing. Also, he has smartly reinvested his money and brokered several lucrative brand partnerships.</p><p class="sc-bA-DUxO bSiVrH"><span>Lewis Hamilton</span></p><p class="sc-jVSHhB eSHvkk">F1 Driver</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $285 Million</p><p style=text-align:start>Lewis Hamilton is a F1 driver and seven time champion.

In more recent years, though, Mercedes has fallen off the pace of other companies and Lewis hasn't won a race since 2021.</p><p style=text-align:left>"I thought about and watched the Ferrari drivers on the screens at the track and of course you wonder what it would be like to be in red," he said when inking his new deal with Mercedes. At the time, he described Mercedes as "home," but this news seems to suggest that Lewis is ready to find a new home as he enters the later stages of his career.</p><p>The new F1 season is set to begin at the end of February, and while none of this news is official, it does create an odd feeling of finality for Lewis entering the 2024 season. This may be his final run with the team that made him one of the highest-paid athletes in sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobK4tdJmn5qlmaHBsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
