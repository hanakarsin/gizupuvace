Source: TikTok/@ashy_anne_ While teaching is one of the noblest professions an individual can take on, educators should never overstep certain boundaries. One issue that has come up countless times is deciding what children can and cannot eat — especially when busy parents are the ones packing their kids’ lunchboxes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She couldn’t believe that her son’s teacher “shamed him in front of his friends” and wanted to ensure that it never happened again.</p><p>However, the creator wondered if she should wait for another incident before contacting her child’s school.</p><p>And naturally, TikTok couldn’t wait to offer its two cents on how Ashy Anne should approach the food fiasco. “Definitely say something,” one user urged. “Yes yes yes.”</p><p>Another person shared what they started doing when their child’s school became involved with the contents of their son’s lunchbox: “I sent a note to my kid’s school telling them that until they supply his food, then they have no say. Period.”</p><p>Someone else offered advice involving a pediatric dietitian’s method. “Dr. Kyla from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toddler Mealtimes</a> makes the best stickers for inside lunch boxes that, in other words, tell [teachers] to back off,” they wrote.</p><p>And the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sticker message</a> couldn’t be better: “Everything in this lunchbox has been packed by someone who really cares. Please let my child eat as much of these foods as they feel like, in whatever order they choose.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbKir8eeqWavn6q5pbrTZqapnZ5iuKqw0maamqOV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
