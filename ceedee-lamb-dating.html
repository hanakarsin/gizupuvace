His heart only has enough love in it for the one lucky girl that he's dating.</p><p>The wide receiver, born Cedarian DeLeon, spent his collegiate football career playing for the Oklahoma Sooners. That's where he first met his longtime girlfriend, Crymson Rose, but the pair split, which means that CeeDee is back on the market. Is he dating anyone?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who is CeeDee Lamb dating?</h2><p>CeeDee is currently single, as far as the public knows. He was dating Crymson Rose, but they no longer seem to be together. After the pair met during in college, CeeDee was drafted into the NFL and she, seemingly, was by his side.</p><p>However, the moment CeeDee was drafted might have spurred some trouble between the pair. While he was receiving his call from the Cowboys, Crymson reached over and took his phone out of his lap. CeeDee quickly snatched it back.</p><p>Crymson gave a mischievous smile to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">camera</a> while CeeDee just shook his head. Fans have long considered Crymson's move as a sign of disrespect and a total red flag.</p><p>Details on when exactly the pair split are hazy. At some point after that tense Draft Day exchange, everything seemed to fall apart. They made a quiet separation, not really drawing much attention to their breakup.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Crymson Rose (@crymsonrose)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who is Crymson Rose?</h2><p>Crymson is a Christian content creator with a following of about 30,000 on Instagram. Plus, she played basketball which made her and CeeDee a totally sporty couple.</p><p>Before dating CeeDee, she dated Atlanta Hawks superstar point guard Trae Young in high school. Both of the basketball players went on to Oklahoma University where they ultimately broke up.</p><p>After dating CeeDee, Crysmon seems to have moved on. While her social media has gone pretty quiet over the past few years, she has left a post up where she is posing with a new guy.</p><p>"Happy birthday to my sweetest love. It’s easy to find gratitude in this life with you. With God’s will I’ll be celebrating this day forevaa," she captioned the post. Crymson tagged a man named Antonio, but his profile is private, indicating that he would rather live a life outside of the limelight.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Crymson Rose (@crymsonrose)</a></p></figure><p>Even further confirming that the pair are romantically linked, Antonio set the link in his Instagram bio to Crymson's Instagram page. Anyone doing a little bit of stalking will quickly realize that he's cuffed.</p><p>Fans are a bit hateful in Crymson's comment section, telling her to stay away from this new guy. Plus, they love to poke fun at the fact that she split from CeeDee. "Went from CeeDee ta this cause you couldn't sit still," one wrote about the awkward phone incident.</p><p>"Fumbling CeeDee is wild and Trae Young and now with a nobody respect to you for keeping a smile on your face," another fan wrote. Many people also flooded the comment section with GIFs and photos of Crymson's now-ex.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLKmsMSeZKWZnZd6pa3ToqWg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
