"I just think he's so fun to watch. I know that's kind of a generic thing to say, but when we were auditioning people for the role — and I think it's funny to talk about it now because I don't think Lukas will be auditioning much in his future."</p><p>She went on to say that the You team is "fortunate" to work with Lukas at this "earlier" stage in his career.</p><p>Furthermore, Sera relayed that the 27-year-old actor embodies exactly what they envisioned for the character of Adam.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"It was so obvious to my partners, Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter ... they were like, just skip to Lukas. He was exactly all of these characteristics that Greg and I kept talking about: The mix of boyishness and striving and, um, you know, both believing that this guy has a lot of casual power and callousness, and also that he's genuinely damaged by his family, and he does want to be taken seriously," she shared, giving us more insight into his character.</p><p>You can catch Lukas Gage in Season 4, Part 1 of You, which hits <a href=#>Netflix</a> on Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXZaxormMsqauZaOarrS7zWZr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
