It is hard to envy a man who is watching things fall apart all around him just months after he appeared to fly high politically; or even worse, a suitor who is avoided like the plague by the girls he is pursuing relationships with.

Coming hot on the heels of another cooperation agreement between Jubilee and Gideon Moi’s Kanu, the deal has further weakened the DP and complicated his equation, making it obvious that Mudavadi would be joining a losing side if he teamed up with the increasingly isolated DP.</p><p class=align-left>The earlier working relationship between ODM and Jubilee triggered by the 2018 Handshake between Kenyatta and Raila had already made Parliament an unfavourable ground for Ruto to fight his political wars.</p><p class=align-left>The situation could get gloomier for the DP if the current turbulence facing ANC and Ford Kenya is anything to go by.</p><p class=align-left>Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula was recently temporarily toppled from his position in a party coup that saw Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi officially crowned the new party leader.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Gavana Sonko ambatiza Rais Uhuru na kumpa jina la Munaa</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/bfc7a38c2fafbc54.jpeg><p class=align-left>The ‘coup’ plotters, among them Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, publicly declared that they do not want to be in government and are not ready to be left out of the important national conversation that is taking place. Such a candid declaration signalled that it is a matter of time before Ford Kenya also joins the ruling coalition.</p><p class=align-left>Mudavadi is equally facing ouster from ANC amid reports that his term as party leader expired this week. The whirlwind revolutions brewing in the two parties leave Ruto with no formidable and stable party to work with. Pacts with the Farmers Party, Nuru Party and Sisi kwa Sisi among others will not win him the top job.</p><p class=align-left>The DP is in a real catch-22, fast running out of time and options. With a return to the heart of the Jubilee fold now virtually impossible, it is getting increasingly likely that he could shelve his 2022 ambitions altogether and vie in subsequent elections when the conditions could be more favourable.</p><p class=align-left><strong>The writer is Sammy Kwinga, a regular commentator on social, economic and political affairs.</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
