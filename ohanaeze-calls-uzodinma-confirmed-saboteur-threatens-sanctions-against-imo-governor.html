This is as the anti-open grazing law was already operational in Ogun, Abia, Oyo, Ekiti, and Ebonyi states prior to the resolution of the governors.</p><p>But Uzodinma, who spoke with newsmen on Wednesday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, said: “I don’t have any law in Imo State for anti-grazing.</p><p>“What we have done is that we are regulating grazing activities in Imo State under a partnership between our farmers and herders. They have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in my office and agreed to work together. And both parties are going about their businesses without interfering or causing any grievance or anger to each other.”</p><p>In its reaction, Ohanaeze disclosed that this position of Uzodinma has attracted scourge of hatred, plagues, and curses on his government, adding that Ndigbo would declare him the number one enemy of their race.</p><p>The Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, <strong>Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro</strong>, in a statement, said, “Our suspicion had been reinforced with the continued absence of Governor Hope Uzodinma in the meetings of Southern Governors in Asaba and Lagos, which was intentional and premeditated to ambush the resolutions of the Southern Governors, and he will never escape the venom of Ndigbo.</p><p>“He will surely taste the retribution of God and wrath of the people as a confirmed saboteur and this will serve as a warning to any Igbo Governor that will follow such decision. Such person will never escape the venomous actions of the people.”</p><p>Ohanaeze went on to advise Governor Uzodinma “to show repentance and rescind as he cannot afford to face the consequences of this decision.</p><p>“Uzodinma is now the tool our detractors is using to destabilize Southern Nigeria. If he continues, he will be excommunicated from any Igbo gathering and ceremonies from 1st September 2021.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FwZqigkaOupsbEZpqapJyoerbGzp2gp6WRYrCwusWiqaadlGLAoq7OrZyuql2ptbOxwK2cp6tdqK6vr9OipqerXZa0orXNrKtmoZ2keqi71Z6pp6eiZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
