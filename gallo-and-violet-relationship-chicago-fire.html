Now in Season 11, Chicago Fire is taking major steps to clear up their relationship status. Read on for what we know about Gallo and Violet.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Adrian S.

While fans grew to root for the pairing, Gallo's feelings for Violet made it uncomfortable even as he did his best to be supportive. Particularly when Violet and Hawkins rekindled their romance in Season 11, Gallo was clearly heartbroken.</p><p>But then <a href=#>Hawkins' unexpected death</a> changed everything, leaving Violet destroyed and Gallo in the best friend role.</p><p>"Romantically, I don’t think Gallo even has that door open anymore right now because of everything Violet's gone through," actor Alberto Rosende told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Insider</a> in December 2022. "Remember, Gallo knew Evan Hawkins as well. So there's this hole there that wasn’t there before."</p><p>Just two months later, though, there's been a massive change of plans that audiences will not be surprised by, but definitely interested in.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Adrian S. Burrows/NBC</span><p>Alberto Rosende as Blake Gallo, Hanako Greensmith as Violet, Kara Killmer as Sylvie Brett on 'Chicago Fire.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Gallo and Violet get back together on 'Chicago Fire'?</h2><p>In Chicago Fire Season 11, Episode 14, "Run Like Hell," the newest floater temporarily assigned to Firehouse 51 expresses a romantic interest in Violet. Seeing Muncell (played by Max Stewart) possibly moving in on his ex once again drags up old feelings in Gallo—leading to Gallo and Violet sharing a kiss.</p><p>The kiss won't be shocking to viewers, who know that the NBC series never keeps its main characters single for very long.</p><p>Even though Violet's partner Sylvie Brett found "love at first sight" with Matthew Casey, <a href=#>Brett and Casey's romance</a> fizzled out (via phone no less!) when Jesse Spencer left the series and Brett has already moved on to date Dylan (portrayed by Christopher Allen).</p><p>The only question is if Gallo and Violet's kiss will lead to their officially becoming a couple again. They tried to keep things casual the first time, and that obviously didn't work out. But they've also built a very strong friendship.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>So will Violet be ready to commit to something serious with Gallo, especially after losing her last boyfriend so tragically? And can Gallo keep from messing things up with Violet a second time? That'll be a question Chicago Fire fans will see answered throughout the rest of the season, but this kiss is a huge step forward for a couple that seemed like they'd always wind up back together.</p><p>Chicago Fire airs Wednesdays at 9:00 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6tuM5mmKecXau2sLjErWSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdmLWqr8Cgpmaemaey</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
