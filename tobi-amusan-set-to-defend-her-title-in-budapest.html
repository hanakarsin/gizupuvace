She won a gold medal in the tournament after setting the current world record of 12.12 seconds (+0.9m/s) in the semi-final and then followed it up with a 12.06 seconds (+2.5m/s) race in the final.</p><p>From 19 August 2023 to 27 August 2023, Tobi Amusan would be representing Nigeria in the track and field event in the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary. All eyes will be on her to defend her record and her title or probably set a new record.</p><p>Ahead of the championship, the 26-year-old Nigerian athlete ran her previous best at the Ostrava Golden Spike Meet in June with a time of 12.47 seconds, which is a significant improvement over her current record.</p><p>After that, Amusan set a new season’s best time of 12.34 seconds on Sunday, July 16, to win the women’s 100-meter hurdles competition at the Silesia Diamond League competition in Poland.</p><p>She also equaled the meeting record set in 2022 by Puerto Rican Jasmine Camacho Quinn.</p><p>After recording a season-best ahead of the World Championship, Amusan recognized that the race had a difficult beginning, but the results showed important advancement before her title defense in Hungary.</p><p>“It was not easy for me with injuries in my hamstring and my knee. But I trusted in my coach and my work. It is all about the process. I just won this in a smooth style, I was just running. Honestly, I had no idea that I won when I crossed the finish line,” she said.</p><p>“About the World Championships, I take it one step after the next. I am most definitely building up for the World Championships, and extremely satisfied with my SB – one step at a time.</p><p>“About my start — I would not say that I executed, but the second part of the race was really good. I knew it was going to be a battle until the finish line. I am happy to compete against the best. I am just out here doing well; I would not say that I am the best. I came out there and I was not feeling too good.”</p><p>Based on her performance so far this season, it will be a huge shock if Tobi Amusan fails to at least successfully defend her world title in Hungary next month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BwZq2nkp56ornUrJinZaOawW7Azmabnp6Vo7FutMSrZK2hpKGybrXNZpmunJGlsrTAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
