It's one thing to show your support for those affected by a tragedy in whatever way you can, but when there are active solutions that people can use to prevent certain tragedies, thoughts and prayers simply aren't enough. Many people criticize the term "thoughts and prayers" as a catch-all term for people who pretend to care about tragedies while avoiding taking steps that would stop them from ever happening again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Thoughts and prayers, especially when it comes to the epidemic of mass shootings in the United States, are not enough. These memes are poignant reminders that words do not equate to action. When people — especially those in positions of power — have the ability to prevent chaos and tragedy, then they need to do more than offer thoughts and prayers.

Stricter gun regulations are a far more feasible response to the shooting, but Ted already knows that. He regularly profits from gun-rights transactions and could stand to lose his fortune if he imposed more regulations.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">That time of year in the United States ...</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's "thoughts and prayers" season in America.</p>— Beke (@BK9419) <a href=#>May 24, 2022</a></figure><p>According to a recent report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, more than 212 mass shootings have occurred all over the country in the first five months of 2022. Twenty-seven of those incidents have taken place in schools, resulting in injury and/or death every time.
