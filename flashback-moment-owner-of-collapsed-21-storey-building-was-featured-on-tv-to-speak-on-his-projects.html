Speaking to the broadcaster, he said;</p><p>“…. I applied for a 2-storey extension in UK, the council wanted to write 2 storey, they made a mistake. So when we started developing it some people, neighbors went to report. You know when you have a 2 storey in London, you can’t do a 3 storey, 2 storey must go all the way. So they went to report me to the council, the council came, they agreed that they made a mistake, that I should not do the 3-storey, I went ahead and did the 3-storey. Then we went for a committee at the committee I won. That’s how we did the 3 storey….”</p><p>Talking about his working relationship with experts, he said:</p><p>“When I first came to Nigeria, I believed in consultants so much. If an architect tells me something, I will do whatever he tells me to do…. I later realized that some people they only Know book, they do not understand the practical aspect of the work.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> earlier reported that<a href=#> Femi Osibona was declared dead on 5th November.</a> This came after he was trapped inside the 21-storey building under construction alongside one of his friends, Bob Oseni.</p><p>Watch the video below;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49uZp%2Bkkai1o63CpGSmp52au7V5zrClnqpdpLNur86lo5qoo5qxbn6QZqqtp6Kaxm6u1KKjnaGenHq4rdJmnZ6ZpKq%2FprCMqKVmrKZiwbB50qmcmqNdpLtutMisZKmqn5%2BypMDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
