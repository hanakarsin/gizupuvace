And if you're eagerly anticipating the release of the new game like I am, here is absolutely everything you need to know about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kingdom Hearts mobile game</a> before it comes out.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Welcome to the official Twitter page for "Project Xehanort", an all-new KINGDOM HEARTS experience planned for Spring 2020!</p><p>Read about our "Guess the Name" Twitter campaign on the Project Xehanort website: <a href=#>https://t.co/G8NEwhmS2Y</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/S5cWIyCdJN</a></p>— Project Xehanort (@projectxehanort) <a href=#>January 23, 2020</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Here's what we know about the game so far:</h2><p>The working title for Kingdom Hearts' latest creation, according to Kotaku, is Project Xehanort. There is not yet much information regarding the object of the game yet, but on Twitter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the brand described it as</a> "an all-new KINGDOM HEARTS experience." So obviously, it has to be incredible.</p><p>Those who are familiar with the popular series know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Xehanort is a major character</a> within the vast world of Kingdom Hearts. According to Kingdom Hearts Wiki, he is the central antagonist of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Seeker Saga</a> as well as a Keyblade Master, who used to teach Ventus. He believes that darkness and light must co-exist, and is on an ongoing quest to defeat Kingdom Hearts, to ultimately recreate the world.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">"Why did he become the seeker of darkness?"</h2><p>Square Enix's webpage for the video game boasts the mysterious tagline: "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why did he become the seeker of Darkness</a>?" So obviously, this leaves us wondering what this could possibly mean in terms of the characters gamers will encounter, as well as the overall object of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few guesses one could make that might explain the meaning of this foreboding tagline, but Games Radar presumes that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the game will most likely explain "Xehanort's fall to darkness"</a> as well as his transformation into a villain, within the Kingdom Hearts series. Spooky.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Kingdom Hearts' wants fans to guess the OFFICIAL name of the game.</h2><p>While Project Xehanort is the "working title" for the game, it isn't what the game is officially called. Square Enix's Twitter account for Project Xehanort <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted a promotion</a> for fans to "Guess the Name" of the upcoming Project Xehanort title, and while we aren't sure what the prize is, it definitely sounds enticing.</p><p>To enter, fans are required to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow the Project Xehanort Twitter account</a>, tweet what they believe could be the official title, and include the hashtag #KHNameContest, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the rules and regulations</a>. There will be a total of 10 winners selected, and although a prize wasn't specified, I'm down to try and win anyway.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Welcome to the official Twitter page for "Project Xehanort", an all-new KINGDOM HEARTS experience planned for Spring 2020!</p><p>Read about our "Guess the Name" Twitter campaign on the Project Xehanort website: <a href=#>https://t.co/G8NEwhmS2Y</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/S5cWIyCdJN</a></p>— Project Xehanort (@projectxehanort) <a href=#>January 23, 2020</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When can we expect to play the new 'Kingdom Hearts' mobile game?</h2><p>As of right now, there isn't <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an official release date for the new Kingdom Hearts game</a>, but according to Square Enix's official website, fans will be able to play the new game as of Spring 2020.
