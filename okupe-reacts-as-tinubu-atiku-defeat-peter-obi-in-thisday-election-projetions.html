He added that the Labour Party presidential candidate will also garner massive votes in the South-West, South-South, and North-West than the projected stats.</p><p>He tweeted: “I wish to say categorically and with a very high sense of responsibility & objectivity, that the projections are false, bogus & do not represent the actual situation on ground across the nation. They are essentially aimed at misinforming the public.</p><p>“Peter obi will win and lead massively in the South-East averagely (70%) including all states in the South-South. In the South-West, Peter Obi will score min of 40% in Lagos. 25% in Ogun, Oyo, Ekiti & Ondo. Osun 15% minimum. North-West 40% min in Kaduna & no less than 10% of all the other 6 states mainly bcos of Igbo residents.</p><p>“Thisday projections ignored many important electoral parameters that have operated in our polity over more than 60yrs. Without any doubt PO will score 25% in no less than 24/25 states including Taraba, Adamawa & Gombe & will lead all the other 3 numerically. He is the candidate to beat.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FwZqijpaWybr7Empqtq12WwG7AyKesm61dlsGqt9Rmm56elZbBbrzErZyrZZ%2BXtm61zWaroaGjma66ecSlnJysmaS7brzRqKGerJmku7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
