This is directly reflected in the odds for their contest.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jake Paul is favored by oddsmakers against Tyron Woodley.</h2><p>As of now on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportsbetting.ag</a>, Jake Paul is a -160 favorite to win against the former UFC Welterweight Champion. Woodley, on the other hand, is a +130, meaning you will earn $130 for every $100 that you bet on "The Chosen One" to win.</p><p>For Paul, Woodley represents a step up in competition, as he's demonstrated that he at least somewhat knows how to throw a punch.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Although Tyron Woodley has no professional boxing experience, he has some knockout victories in MMA.</h2><p>Woodley's strong suit is wrestling: He's an NCAA Division 1 wrestler, a two-time All-American, and a Big 12 champion. If you know anything about that mat life, you know how big of a deal that really is.</p><p>And while he has demonstrated explosiveness in his striking, specifically good counter punching that finds its mark (just ask Josh Koscheck), it's important to note that MMA is a heck of a lot different than boxing.</p><p>It's difficult to focus on throwing one's hands and utilizing footwork when you're not worried about someone shooting a double leg on you or tying you up and tripping you. Tyron was able to land significant strikes against his opponents because they were aware of his wrestling pedigree.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Leaked footage of Tyron Woodley vs. Jake Paul <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BtVUB9SF5e</a></p>‚Äî Se√°n Sheehan (@SeanSheehanBA) <a href=#>May 31, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tyron Woodley's height, weight, reach, size, age, and other stats will be a factor in his match against Jake Paul.</h2><p>Paul usually tips the scales at around 189 pounds and Woodley has competed at 170 pounds for the majority of his UFC career. That being said, Woodley used to cut down to make that weight, so expect him to be around Jake's weight when the two face off.</p><p>Tyron is billed at 5'9" with a 74-inch reach, whereas Jake's 6'1", and has a reach of 76 inches. As of this writing, Woodley's also 39 years old and Paul is 15 years younger.</p><p>Many are hoping that Woodley will be able to knock Jake out and silence the "wannabe" fighter once and for all, but he's proven he can wobble and stun even a notoriously hard-chinned opponent like Ben Askren.</p><p>The former One FC and Bellator Welterweight Champion had a serious wrestling pedigree and made no secrets about his disdain for striking. The reason Askren got into MMA was so he could get paid to competitively wrestle, more or less.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyron Woodley loses 15 rounds in a row and gets submitted in his last ever ufc fight. 4 fight L streak.</p><p>He comes back to Box Jake Paul and knocks him the fuck out.</p><p>JUST IMAGINE IT <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CyH93JlZHv</a></p>‚Äî ·¥Ä Ä·¥õ·¥èÍú∞·¥°·¥Ä Äüóøüèù (@MiracleMMA__) <a href=#>May 31, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the date for Jake Paul and Tyron Woodley's upcoming bout?
