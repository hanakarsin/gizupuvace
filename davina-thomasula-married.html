They set up shop in their neighborhood in Poughkeepsie, New York, and signed a lease two weeks before the pandemic hit.</p><p>“That was a crazy time but we’ve now been open for about six months and it’s been great," Kristin said. "including the fact we get to hire locals and give back to the community, which was always one of our top goals."</p><p>She continued,“It’s a little bar — only about 700 square feet . When you’re there you feel like you’re hanging out with people in your living room.”</p><p>The bar was named Goodnight Kenny as a tribute to Davina's father Kenny. Davina said that the name came from when Kenny worked long nights as a musician and napped during the day.</p><p>"Goodnight Kenny is what we scream to him every time he goes for a nap," Davina explained.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Davina is a proud dog owner.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Davina Thomasula (@davinathomasula)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a><p>Davina and her dog on Instagram</p></figure><p>The longtime partners also share two dogs, Stephen (a 4-year-old rescue) and Winston (a 5-year-old Brussels griffon).</p><p>"We like giving our pets human names,” Kristin joked. “We found Stephen, who was about 9 months old at the time, roaming a street in Poughkeepsie.
